This fire within me is consuming me every moment. I am melting, as if my conscience is inflicting
the agony of the mistake I made... It hurts... It hurts
so much that while I am alive, it feels like my flesh
is being sliced apart... I say to myself, ‘How can I
go back and fix everything? How can I repay the
efforts I wasted? What about the presence of Allah!
How can I repay the rights of others when death
knocks on my door and the moment of judgment
arrives? I... I cannot understand... How could I
make such a mistake? How could I be so blind?
How could I be so thoughtless... I am so remorseful! Oh Allah! This weak servant cannot turn back
time, surely... But is there no way for them to
become as if they never committed the mistake?
Show me a way out... How can I rid myself of this
torment of conscience? I don’t even have the courage to commit the same mistake again... Besides...
I have no hope left for myself... That’s why, how will
I extinguish this fire now? How will I undo what I
have done? I have no idea... I am constantly consuming my life and breaths with the same question: ‘Tell me, O heart, are you remorseful?
