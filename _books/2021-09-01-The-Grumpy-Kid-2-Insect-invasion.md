Come on, come on
Don't wait, open up and start reading!
Spring has arrived in Creaky Town. Everyone
is spreading smiles with joy. But even amidst all this cheer, is there anyone who won't be cheered up, whose face won't crack a smile?
Yes, of course, it's Mert!
Because what if one of those spring pollens enters his nose
and keeps bouncing around inside his head, not letting him sleep for a moment??? You might think there's nothing more terrible than that in the world, right? But I must tell you, you're wrong! Because if every night the grains in town start getting stolen by "unknown" thieves, and people involuntarily fall asleep...
Your friends, your mom, dad, siblings...
Now, that's truly terrifying!
And what if to find out the reason for this, you have to follow the terrifying bugs into the terrifying mine???
Okay okay, don't be scared, solving this is definitely the job for the brave!
Are you up for it? Well, let's see some proof! Getting into that mine isn't easy at all. Just so you know, you can quietly follow Mert, Zek, Nehir, and the new girl, Fındık...
But don't make a sound, or you might get caught in a bug invasion,

SHHHHHHHHHH!

This book is FILLED WITH BUGS!!!
