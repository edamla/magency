A young urban writer, caught up in the rush of
writing his new book... And an elderly sage living
alone in a remote corner of a distant village... Their
paths cross. The book the young writer intended
to write changes completely. Only the last chapter
of his book is from his own pen. In fact, he doesn’t
even want to write that chapter himself. But after
a shocking surprise, he is forced to complete the
book.
“The Man Who Chose the Bruised Tomato” is a
compelling memoir-novel from the pen of the master writer Vehbi Vakkasoğlu, where you will find the
sweet examples of Anatolian wisdom...
