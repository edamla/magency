Matti lives in Paris with his foster family. His real
family disappeared when he was very young. Ev-
eryone says they are dead, but Matti has a differ-
ent opinion. As he grows up, he becomes deter-
mined to search for them.
Matti also has a friend named Tink. Tink is a
dreamer who imagines an interesting and ad-
venturous life. However, it will be Matti who first
discovers the opportunity to meet the mysterious
outside world.
His uncle Jussi takes Matti to the Drekar Mohoao
Island, the headquarters of the Dragon Knights
Fellowship. Matti doesn’t believe in all this dragon
nonsense and finds his uncle Jussi and his friends
strange. That is until he comes face to face with a
real dragon...
The first book in the “Dragon Knights Fellowship”
series, Dragon Island, opens the door to an adven-
ture-filled world.
