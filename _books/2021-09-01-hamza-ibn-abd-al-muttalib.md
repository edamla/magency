On the eve of that unique period of bliss in
Mecca, one of the most formidable stalwarts of its
inhabitants was undoubtedly Hamza. By nature, he
loved hunting, adventure, valor, and disliked a still
life. Returning from the hunt, meeting the Kaaba
and circumambulating it would give him a different pleasure. For some reason, something broke
inside him, his heart would melt while he was
circumambulating.
The sight of Hamza’s circumambulation on the
way back from the hunt was worth seeing, because the humble attitude of Hamza, who was a
valiant man who did not bow to the mountains, was
more valuable than others who were not as brave
as him. Because it would not be so remarkable for
those who had already bowed their heads in their
lives to bow before the Kaaba, but Hamza was not
like that; How this upright head, who would not
bend even such mountains by the neck, bowed
respectfully in front of the Kaaba.
