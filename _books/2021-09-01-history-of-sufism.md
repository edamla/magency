Mehmed Ali Aynî is one of the important thinkers
of the last periods of the Ottoman Empire and the
first years of the Republic. He worked as an educator for many years; He gave lectures and worked
as an administrator in fields such as history, languages, statistics, and Sufism.
In this book, Aynî examines in detail the understanding of Sufism in India, Egypt, Greece, Alexandria, Judaism and Christianity, and subsequently
the emergence, development and principles of
Sufism in Islam. He explains that Sufism is included in all beliefs, that they all have similar aspects
and that they all have various educational stages
for spiritual education.
This work is a profound book that teaches the
background of the history of Sufism, shows that
many people whose names we often hear and call
“philosophers” actually have schools of Sufism,
and will change the perspective of those who read
it...
