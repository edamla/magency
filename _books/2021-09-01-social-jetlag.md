This book is about the clock in our brain. This
clock is an internal, ticking clock, a commander inside us, dictating what should be done when. This
book is about rhythm. It’s about the rhythm present in space, plants, and animals, in music, in our
emotions, thoughts, and behaviors, in our health
and illness, in every passing second, in everything
stationary and moving. It’s a rhythm that causes
chaos when disturbed and leaves us in awe when
it functions healthily. This book is about our perspective on life. Everything we notice isn’t random;
it will change our perspective on life. It will offer a
different perspective on the world, living beings,
events, and most importantly, on ourselves. When
we see the determined cycles instead of randomness, we’ll notice the difference and redesign our
lives. This book will encourage us to correct disrupted rhythms and reset our clocks according to
their natural settings.
