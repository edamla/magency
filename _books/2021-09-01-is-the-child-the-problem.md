This book has been prepared in light of the
author’s scientific research on child development.
The focus of the book is on children and their natural needs. Accordingly, the most valid advice on the
problems children face today and their solutions
has been provided to adults.
Indeed, the world is changing at a dizzying pace.
Many of the new developments are leading to
threatening consequences for families and children. As parents, we constantly need to update
ourselves on how to approach and what roles to
adopt. However, within the sources that have become a dump of information, we don’t know how to
find the truth.
Prepared from a developmental perspective by
Prof. Dr. Serdal Seven, this work will be the bedside book for parents in understanding the natural
needs of children.
