“Bora Bey wanted to hold Elif Kız by her shoul-
ders. But he quickly pulled back his arms, which
were trembling towards her:
“Look, Elif Girl,” she said. ‘You cannot know this
feeling… We are engaged to our sword. Our wed-
ding will be on horseback. Our groom’s suit is our
shroud.
Our grave, which will one day be dug where we
will fall with a treacherous arrow or a treacherous
dagger blow; it will be our pilgrimage place…”
“This last word pierced the soul of that hopeless
love like a poisoned dagger…”
Those who gave their lives for the sake of “Allah”
and passed through the soul, leaving their swords
as witnesses, they drank the sherbet of martyr-
dom...
Covering the period from the enthronement of
Suleiman the Magnificent to his death, this novel is
the story of history within history.
