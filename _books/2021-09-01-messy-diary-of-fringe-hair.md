Emmy is 11 years old girl with a long messy hair. She doesn’t like wearing pink clothes(well, she only wears black or gray clothes) as other girls. She is also a little bit depressive and  grumpy, too.

The only reason why she acts like this is that everybody around her expects her to be and behave like a “normal girl”. When others started intervening in her life, began criticizing her to play football like boys, to wear boys’ trousers, to hate girly clothes, to call her sleepy and messy, she fed up and decided to turn a whole new page in her life. (By the way, she loves cats A LOT!)

When she told her parents that she decided to turn a new page in life, her parents got happy like crazy. But they didn’t know that Emmy only meant to buy a diary from stationery.

When she was late to school at the first day and things went wrong, when she also played for school’s football team for boys and participated in a knowledge contest with her best girl friend and couldn’t comb her hair nicely, she had to open new pages one after another.

She will realize it so lately that her efforts to be a clean and popular girl will move her away from her real-
unique personality and best friends.
