Stars receive their light from the Sun. They appear at night and disappear during the day. They
adorn the sky and bring light to darkness.
There are earthly stars that derive their light from
the Sun of humanity. These earthly stars radiate
brightness around them day and night. But to truly
see them, one needs eyes capable of perceiving
reality...
Earthly stars are the beauty and adornment of
our spiritual world. Humanity is enriched and gains
value through them. They are examples who have
lived a life worth living. They turn our nights into
days and illuminate our hearts.
One of them, and indeed one of the brightest, is
Imam Azam Abu Hanifa.
His life, filled with lessons, surpasses even the
most thrilling novels. For he is among the finest
examples of faith, wisdom, knowledge, morality,
and courage.
