They were men of heart who united their cause with love and held a
deep affection for children. One of them, Mawlana, once encountered a
group of children. The children playfully surrounded him and declared,
“You are now our prisoner. There is no escape!” Mawlana immediate-
ly joined their game, raising his hands in surrender. Pretending to be
upset, he asked, “How can I free myself from captivity?” The children
responded seriously, “If you offer a ransom, we will release you. Otherwise, you will remain our prisoner!” Mawlana checked his pockets and
took out some walnuts, asking, “Will I be set free if I give these as ransom?” Understanding that the children were seeking gifts, they accepted the walnuts and departed. Mawlana smiled after them and remarked,
“We were released at a bargain, just like Prophet Joseph.”
