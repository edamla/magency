A modern life philosophy based on selfish emo-
tions dominates today. From the countless inci-
dents we reluctantly witness on news programs,
it’s evident that this philosophy doesn’t align with
the human spirit. However, as descendants of a
tradition that hesitates even to harm an ant, we
needed a life model built on compassion. This
could only be possible through the reintroduction
of the Beautiful Names (Esma’ül Hüsna) into our
lives, leading to the development of an effective
and universal personality portrait within the frame-
work of Divine names.
But have we missed the opportunity? No! Hatice
Fahrunnisa Kaykı, who has been researching the
Beautiful Names for years, addresses contempo-
rary humanity by focusing on “mercy” in her work.
By introducing the Beautiful Names, which form
the fundamental model of “being moral with God’s
morality,” in different dimensions, she examines
how these names affect our individual and social
development.
This book will not only reveal our compassion for
others but also unveil our self-compassion, contrib-
uting significantly to our spiritual development as
the offspring of a fragile and delicate era.
