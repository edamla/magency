The situation had escalated to the point where
even mentioning a person’s name was enough
reason for them to be killed. The entire country
was engulfed in turmoil, with Mr. Efendi’s family
being no exception. His six adult children were
divided, with some being targeted by right-wing
factions and others by left-wing groups. The family
was deeply affected by the anarchic events of the
time, leading to internal conflicts and estrangement
among the siblings. Mr. Efendi’s greatest fear was
losing his children, and this fear became reality
when his son Tuna was arrested for a murder he
did not commit, while another son, Şahin, committed a shocking act. As the family grapples with
these challenges, the backdrop of the 1980 coup
adds to their struggles. “Efendi Bey” provides an
analysis of the family dynamics amidst the chaos
of the pre-coup era and its aftermath, offering a
glimpse into the recent history of Turkey.
