While writing this book, I couldn’t help but recall
my youth. Some 60 years ago, during my middle
or high school years, I would constantly ask myself the same question: “As I step into youth, who
should I choose as an ‘example’? Whom should I
resemble so that I can guide my life accordingly?”
Of course, at that age, the only thing I thought
about was becoming famous. Everyone should
know and love me. Even if they didn’t respect me,
they should envy me. After all, for many years, the
examples presented to me were always famous
individuals: musicians, actors, artists... In other
words, those applauded by everyone. As a mem-
ber of the ‘68 Generation, I eventually set out with
a guitar. Unfortunately, I wasted my most valuable
years for that reason. But then I realized that the
“real applause” was the applause of the angels. It
was in Allah’s and the Prophet’s pleasure. From
this point on, I tried to show the “BEST EXAMPLE”
by narrating the life of our Prophet. Choosing such
an example is the key to “eternal youth.”
