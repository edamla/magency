When you visit any bookstore today, you can come
across dozens of books related to “motherhood.” However, strangely enough, there is not much written or discussed about the other cornerstone of the family, which
is equally important, “fatherhood.” In the modern world,
the mission attributed to the father seems to be limited
to merely earning money and providing for the family.
However, recent sharp fractures observed in families
have proven how wrong this perception is. It should not
be forgotten that children are the most precious trust
given to us, and raising this trust in the best way possible is the joint responsibility of both the mother and
the father. A responsible father’s guidance, ethics, and
good example cannot be replaced by the mother alone,
someone else, or any institution.
Fatherhood is almost like an art. A father should care
for his child with the demeanor of an artist holding his
most precious creation. Only in this way can the triangle
of a happy mother, a happy child, and a happy father be
completed.
