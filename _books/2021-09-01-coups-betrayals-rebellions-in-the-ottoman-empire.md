The history of coups in our country dates back to
ancient times. In the Ottoman Empire, coups that
left their marks were frequently witnessed. These
were defined as ‘revolt,’ ‘rebellion,’ and ‘uprising’
during that era, but all of them were considered as
‘treason.’ Gürbüz Azak, a master name in Bâbıâli,
narrates the coups, betrayals, and rebellions that
occurred throughout Ottoman history in this work.
The consequences of these attempts and the fates
of those who sought to overthrow the sultans are
depicted vividly, like a film strip. Those who defied
the Ottoman Palace and sought to depose the sul-
tans from their thrones to install individuals of their
own liking generally faced both societal condemna-
tion and violent punishment for their mostly unsuc-
cessful endeavors. To better understand today, it is
necessary to know and comprehend yesterday.
