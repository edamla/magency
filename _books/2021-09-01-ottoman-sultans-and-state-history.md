Written and oral works about the past; It ap-
pears in the form of fairy tales, stories and history.
However, as a science, history must be separated
from story and fairy tale. Our duty is to protect the
borders of history.
Of course, many descriptions of history can
be made, and even a role can be attributed to it
according to the situation and purpose. But this
knowledge, which is a river of experience and
knowledge, should not be taken out of control.
We can compare history in its simple form to an
accounting book. And there, the victory and defeat
in the role of income and expense must be written
correctly so that the calculation is correct in the
end. Because there is no other way to make the
right investment for the future and future account.
