Islamophobia, defined as “anti-Muslim cultural racism,” has roots in Western history, notably
in Orientalism, and has spread beyond Western
societies. Modernization, Westernization, and
Enlightenment ideals in the Islamic world have
also fueled Islamophobia, particularly in countries
influenced by colonialism or radical Westernization.
Turkey, with its strict secular modernization efforts,
is among these countries. Despite recent improvements in state-religion relations and the lifting of
prohibitions, discrimination and prejudices against
Islam and Muslims persist in Turkish society. This
study, the first of its kind and compiled by experts,
investigates Islamophobic discourses, attitudes,
and behaviors across various sectors in Turkey,
including traditional and social media, politics, education, employment, and satire magazines.
