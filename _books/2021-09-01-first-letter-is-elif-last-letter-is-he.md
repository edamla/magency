They say the heart has 99 doors. The name of
‘Allah’ is engraved on the entrance door. And the
doors open with Allah. Then, passing through 98
doors, one reaches ‘Vedud, Rahim’. Each door
has its own beauty and secret. In each door, Allah
manifests Himself differently to His beloved servant. Hence, each door has its own prayer. Hearts
open to Allah with His Beautiful Names. Hearts
are opened to eternity with Allah. And hearts are
entered with Allah... For He is the source of all
loves, affections, passions, and enthusiasms. In
this book, you will feel the sweet breezes reflected
from the Beautiful Names in your heart.
