“Allah’s love for His creation is evident through
His provision for their every need, whether human
or animal, nurturing them with care. He invites
humanity, the most honored among His creations,
to eternal heavens through His mercy. However,
mankind, prone to confusion, lacked knowledge of
the path to paradise, a knowledge reserved only
for the prophets. Thus, God sent prophets in every
era, numbering over a hundred thousand, to guide
humanity. These prophets endured immense hard-
ships and even martyrdom in their sacred duty.
The book provides glimpses of their challenging
lives. As readers explore these stories, they are
prompted to reflect on parallels between events in
today’s world and those in the history of the proph-
ets, including the occurrence of pandemics akin to
the coronavirus.”
