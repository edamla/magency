The passage delves into the primal nature of
humanity, likening it to wolves in a pack where the
weak are consumed. It questions whether despite
our perceived progress, the innate brutality de-
scribed by the Latin phrase “homo homini lupus”
(man is a wolf to man) still persists. The author
ponders why, even in advanced societies, herd
mentality can lead to ruthless and destructive
behavior, seemingly immune to the influences of
morality, culture, or governance. They also con-
template whether the virtual world has any impact
on mitigating these instincts. The book seeks to
comprehend the desire for mass destruction or
collective hysteria, noting its enduring savagery
across different forms. Through an examination
of the historical trajectory of lynching, its motives,
actors, and patterns, the author argues that while
the manifestation of lynching may have changed in
the postmodern era, its essence remains consis-
tent with ancient times. Ultimately, the book aims to
shed light on efforts to prevent lynching as a form
of collective hysteria and provide support in com-
bating it.
