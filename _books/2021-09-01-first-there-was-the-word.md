Once There Was the Word, initially published
in 1995, aimed to provide Turkish readers with a
comprehensive overview of hermeneutical literature, much of which was inaccessible due to
language barriers. Now, a quarter of a century
later, the book returns in an updated and expanded
form. The new edition pays particular attention to
the expansion of hermeneutics in sociology and
theology, emphasizing connections with philosophers like Schleiermacher, Bultmann, Heidegger,
Gadamer, Derrida, and Caputo. Additionally, it
includes a section on the development of interpretive approaches in sociology, spanning from
Dilthey and Husserl to Goffman, Garfinkel, Winch,
and Berger, influenced by hermeneutics. The
book also presents reflections on hermeneutics in
Turkey’s academic and intellectual landscape. Notably, the authors’ evolving perspectives over the
quarter-century between editions contribute to the
book’s richness, making it a compelling hermeneutical experience. In its current form, Once There
Was the Word not only summarizes contemporary
hermeneutical literature but also presents original
insights and invites further discussion.
