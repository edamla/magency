The Wind came, stood right within me.
Come on, it said, come on!
There’s no time for revelry. We’ve wasted too
much time. We’ve kept others waiting for too long.
We’ve missed and been missed.We have those
waiting in the shadows. We have those gathering
in solitude.And the time has come...
The master of pen and words, Uğur Canbolat,
with this book, takes his readers on a journey
through different seasons of humanity. At each
stop, he expresses the various moods of humanity
he encounters with his unique style, sharing them
with his readers. He establishes an unbreakable
connection between what is and what should be by
drawing a thick rope between them.
The author develops a different style with this
book. Combining fiction with essay, he presents
us with a novel-essay in the form of a novella. He
blends literature with knowledge. Of course, it’s
up to us to take and read, and experience these
stories...
