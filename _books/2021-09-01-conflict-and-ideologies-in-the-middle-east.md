The Ideologies of the Quran in the Middle East
presents the intellectual panorama of the region
after a so-called peace(!) that put an end to centuries-old peace and dragged the region into a
vortex. It uncovers the fault lines that led to the
division of the region into various nations despite
its ability to coexist with all its diversities. This book
not only focuses on the long 19th century of the
Middle East but also informs the readers about
various aspects, from problematic nationalisms
that emerged in the context of constitutionalism to
pan-Islamism, Arab nationalism, Ba’athism, and
the use of Shi’ism in Iranian nationalism, as well as
Kurdish nationalism and feminist women’s move-
ments that are attempting to reshape the region in
the horizon of the 21st century.
The stability of the world order is not possible
without rearranging the Middle East. The Middle East is the homeland of Muslim, Christian,
and Jewish traditions, and it is also the cradle of
ancient Mesopotamian and Egyptian traditions.
Without these traditions, the history of humanity’s
journey on earth remains incomplete. It should not
be forgotten that knowing the past of the Middle
East is an essential reference point to understand
the present and the future. This book in your hands
is a concise yet comprehensive guide to understand the Middle East, providing essential and
succinct information.
