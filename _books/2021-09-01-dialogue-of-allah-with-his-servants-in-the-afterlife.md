In this study; We wanted to explain what our
Allah will talk about with us in the hereafter. If a
person knows that these dialogues will happen, he
will try to live more carefully every day of his life, to
get on well with people, not to waste his time, and
to pay attention to his worship.
Thus, he, in the presence of Allah, “My Allah!
That’s all I could do.” Says and he takes refuge in
the infinite mercy of his Allah. Our Rabb has given
great value to His servants. He did not leave them
without a prophet or a book, did not cut off their
sustenance, and gave them a lifetime of time to
repent despite the sins they had committed.
