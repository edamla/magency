11. Peron; the story of those who went from
Anatolia to Europe with a thousand hopes when
Germany started accepting workers in 1961...
In his book, Gökhan Duman narrates the experi-
ences of men, women, and children who built a new
world for themselves but sometimes found them-
selves trapped under the world they constructed,
depicting the ‘foreignness’, the ‘departed’, and the
‘remaining’. Duman’s compelling narrative is en-
riched with photographs from the era, giving it a
documentary-like quality.
“Telling the familiar tale of migration from the
perspectives of those who left and those who stayed,
11th Platform invites the reader to sit in a corner
of the compartment like a passenger on the Sirkeci
train and closely observe what unfolds.
In his work, Gökhan Duman shares the
experiences of our workers who worked in Ger-
many during a certain period through the eyes of
Ibrahim and his family, while also immortalizing
the precious memories of workers who went there
and endured great hardships, sometimes caught in
fires, and at times succumbed to pressures, leaving a
testament of gratitude.
