Ali is the son of an alcoholic father. Just a few
days before his 10th birthday, he sees his grandmother in a dream. This elderly woman, who
passed away months ago, announces to him that
she has chosen a ‘magnificent’ gift for his birthday
and if he uses it, he will fly to Heaven. This gift is
an ‘embroidered’ prayer rug hidden under an old
cupboard. When Ali finds it, he intends to use it,
that is, to pray, but his beloved person stands in
his way... It’s his father, who will scold him at every
opportunity, even beat him severely. Ali’s only
refuge is the prayers he makes in tears. And there
is also their downstairs neighbor, Hakkı Dede, who
helps him, resisting against Ali’s father together...
Prophet Muhammad described prayer as one of
the ‘three things he loved most’ in the world. He
described it as the ‘light of his eyes’ or the ‘pillar of
religion.’ In another saying, he referred to it as the
‘ascension of believers.’ Like the journey experienced during the Ascension, it is a ‘Burak’ that
transports one beyond horizons, even to the heavens... With the book in your hands, Cüneyd Suavi
offers you ‘views of paradise’ from that wonderful
journey. To all children and to everyone whose
heart remains in ‘childlike purity’...
