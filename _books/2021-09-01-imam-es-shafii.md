The spread of Islam to various regions brought
with it new issues and questions to be answered.
With the completion of the revelation of the Quran and the death of our Prophet (pbuh), many of
these questions emerged that were not explicitly
addressed either in the Quran or the hadiths.
In response to this challenge, scientists have devoted much of their time to solving these problems.
Their efforts aimed not only to respond to contemporary problems but also to formulate principles
and methodologies that would guide Muslims in the
centuries to come.
This novel deals with the life of Imam Shafii,
drawing on historical sources, and also explores
the activities of other Islamic jurisprudence and
fiqh scholars. Since Imam Shafii interacted with
scholars from various sects, understanding his life
provides insights into the four major sects of Islam.
