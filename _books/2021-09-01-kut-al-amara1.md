Newspapers in various countries of the world
were not indifferent to this victory of the Turkish
army over the British army, and they interpreted it
in their own way:
“The victory of Kut Al-Amara will leave England
in a difficult situation at home and in its colonies.
Kut’s silence in this way is a great military and
political blow on behalf of the British. As a matter of
fact, Britain’s reputation in the Orient was shaken.
Six months after the defeat at Gallipoli, they suffered a new defeat here, dealing a great blow to
the influence of the British on the Islamic world.
This victory will glorify Turkey’s influence in the
eyes of Muslim communities, and the British will
soon get this on their minds.”
