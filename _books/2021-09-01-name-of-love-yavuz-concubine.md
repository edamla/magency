Yavuz was a brave man on a black horse. With
his sharp eyes, “Behave, my valiants!” not only his
valiants, but also the banner and the bricks were
rearing. “Attack in such a way,” he was sa-ying,
“that even the enemy will not be satisfied with your
hostility!” He was giving the news of a great war.
That concubine? Concubine with a fairy face,
twig height, ruddy cheeks... The concubine whose
dimples bloom when she speaks, and mares run
high in her eyes when she is silent... From the mo-
ment she entered the private room of the palace,
she was giving the news of a great love.
One is a Sultan who rules the world, the oth-
er is a Circassian girl who drinks the sherbet of
martyrdom with the love of that Sultan... And this
magnificent work that has emerged. Every line is
gripping... Every line is impressive...
