Sacit, Macit, Ayse! Three siblings who run
from one adventure to another! Sacit and Macit
are twins but their personalities are different.
Just like their dreams. Ayse wants to be an
author, Sacit wants to be an astronout and Macit
wants to be nothing. And their mischievousness
is over the mountain of Kaf, over the pages of
this book, their fame reached to Mars. We can
call this the adventures of The Incredible Twins.
Ayse wrote it and Sacit and Macit played it. With
the entertaining adventures in it, this series will
drive your children to always think and take
lessons from what happens around them and
teaches them fundamental moral values.
