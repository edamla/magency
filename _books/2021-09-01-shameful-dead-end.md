Our esteemed novelist Üstün İnanç, who keeps
alive the social, cultural, and political life of his era
in his memory and translates them into writing,
presents a segment from the era of oppression that
began in the 1940s and continued until the late
1960s in “Yazıklar Çıkmazı.” The novel tells the
story of our people who were persecuted, scorned,
and marginalized for their beliefs and for living by
those beliefs. İnanç, who possesses a rich language and a fluent style, also shows solutions for
our society, which experienced social turmoil due
to heavy pressures. While portraying the political
and social conflicts of our recent history, the novel
also narrates the story of a family and a nation’s
great struggle for living by the values they believe
in.
