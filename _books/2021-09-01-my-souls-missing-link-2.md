Experiencing psychological distress and problems is not a deficiency. On the contrary, if these
problems and troubles can be evaluated, they are
opportunities for people. That opportunity; It does
not come to eliminate, erase or destroy the painful events, losses, concerns and anger. On the
contrary, it comes to ensure the ability to live with
them. This skill accompanies your evolution process in your life journey and protects you from getting lost spiritually. In order not to get lost spiritually
and not to lose the rings of the soul, it is our duty to
make an effort. In order not to become a prisoner
and victim of negativity, you need to make an effort
to recognize, repair and protect the missing links of
your soul. Knowing, understanding and accepting
yourself is a requirement of being human. You may
be a victim now because of the negative and sad
situations experienced in the past, but you do not
have to be condemned to them. Because being
convicted makes you a victim of that situation.
Every person lives in a mental cage, but some
are free and some are imprisoned in that cage.
Those who are free are those who find the missing
links of their soul and strive to protect them. Those
who find the missing links of their soul know that it
is not just negative thoughts, fears that they think
will never end, anxiety that they think will never go
away, occupied parts of themselves, and feelings
of guilt trapped in a trap, even though they come to
their mind frequently. They also know that they are
a part of the circle of the universe. In this piece, he
has learned to breathe for himself while throwing
negative thoughts and situations into the box they
deserve.
