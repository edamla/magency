Abdullatif Harputi, whose life corresponded to the
end of the 19th century and the beginning of the
20th century, became one of the pioneers of “New
Era Science and Theology” with an innovative approach.
As a matter of fact, while he was writing his
work “Tenkıhu’l Kelâm F’i Akaid-i Ehli’l-Islâm”, he
drew attention to the creed, morality, philosophy,
social and cultural structure of the period, and
said: “When I was assigned to teach the Science
of Kalam in Daru’l-Fünun-ı Osmaniye, I went in
search of a book that contained the basic beliefs
of religion and that stood up to the stubborn and
modern atheists. I have not come across such a
book belonging to the theologians of the past Ahl
as-Sunnah. The science of kalam should be compiled according to the situation and location.
