Andalusian Muslims, who taught science, art and
civilization to Medieval Europe, unfortunately forgot
the brotherhood between them. They constantly
fought with each other because of tribal irritability,
which is clearly prohibited by Islam. Revolts and
coups in Andalusia invited the enemy who had
been waiting for an opportunity for centuries. While
Abu Abdullah, the last Sultan of Beni Ahmer, was
leaving Granada after surrendering the city to the
Catholic kings, he started to cry, looking back from
the Hill of Tears and looking at the Alhambra at the
last turning point on the road to Büşşerat. Seeing
this, his mother Ayşe Sultan said to him: “Now cry
like women for your country, which you cannot
defend like men!” he said. This work tells the sad
story of how the eight-century-long civilization of
Muslims came to an end because of the fights
for the throne; Meanwhile, it also introduces the
excellent works of art and architecture produced in
Andalusia, despite the military and political weakness. Of course, the most important of these architectural works is the Alhambra, the “last castle of
Andalusia”. A phrase repeated perhaps thousands
of times among the embroideries of this magnificent castle-palace shouts to the whole world that
the sole victor is only Allah: Velâ Galibe İllallah.
