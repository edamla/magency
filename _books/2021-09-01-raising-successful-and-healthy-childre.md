Life is a matter of balance...
It is important to establish a balance betwe-en
body and soul, heart and conscience, and happiness and success. Success and health are necessary for all of us, but most and first for our children.
Of course, it is the duty of the parents to ensure
this. Then it belongs to re-latives, neighbors,
schools, the whole society. Because today’s successful and healthy child-ren will be the mothers
and fathers of tomor-row’s more successful and
robust generations. In other words, those who think
a century ahead have no more realistic and easier
way than raising successful and healthy children.
