“Eşref Bey’s orderly, Zenci Musa, has shouldered
his burden and ascended: Prophet Jesus.” - Mehmet Akif Ersoy
“In the days when I had the honor of being one
of those who escaped from Malta and raised the
banner of the National Struggle, Musa, my heroic
Arab, died of tuberculosis.”
Kuşçubaşı Eşref, a warrior of the Ottoman Empire, was born in Sudan and died in the Özbekler
Tekkesi in Üsküdar. He was a member of the
Teşkilat-ı Mahsusa (Special Organization), a heroic
Ottoman soldier. Zenci Musa’s life began in a Turkish neighborhood in Crete, and he was a brave and
loyal warrior who rushed to wherever there was
fire, from Trablusgarp to the Balkans, from Çanakkale to Jerusalem, from the deserts of Yemen to
Anatolia. He met Kuşçubaşı Eşref in the deserts
of Libya and fought on every front the Ottoman
army sent him to until his last breath. He supported the War of Independence from Istanbul, which
was under British occupation. He never faltered,
never succumbed to despair, and fought tirelessly
for the rights and justice of his Muslim brothers
with a sense of ummah consciousness. With this
book, you will witness the atrocities perpetrated by
the enemies of humanity to fulfill their imperialist
ambitions and the struggle of Zenci Musa filled with
lessons.
