During my middle school years, I often heard a
couple of questions repeated in the Quran:Don’t
you ever think? Don’t you use your intellect?
I’m not sure if I’ve followed this command of
Allah. But half a century later, I found myself asking
the same questions again. However, when I did
this, my imagination took me by the hand and led
me to a “dreamlike” realm. Even the stones and
soil of this enjoyable realm seemed alive... Even-
tually, I found myself keeping pace with them and
being compelled to write “peculiar writings” that
made me smile.
During this day-long journey, I sometimes at-
tacked the stones and got beaten up by them.
Sometimes, I conversed with the trees. While argu-
ing with a bird the size of a finger, I learned things I
never knew from it.
If you like, I can tell you about them too, and let’s
all embark on a “Journey to Wonderland” together.
