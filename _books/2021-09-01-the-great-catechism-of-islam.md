This work was created by simplifying the precious work of the deceased Ömer Nasuhi Bilmen,
the retired head of Religious Affairs from Fatih
Dersiam, called “The Great Islamic Catechism”. As
it is known, the catechism; the fard-i ayn that every
Muslim must know; It is a religious book written
to teach the basic knowledge of faith, rituals of
worship, religious matters such as marriage and
halal-haram.
The “Great Islamic Catechism” is at the head of
the great services rendered to Muslims. This work,
which should be in every Muslim’s home, contains
many religious issues.
