Was Andalusia merely a long dream spanning
eight centuries, or was it a great civilization that
brought knowledge, science, and art to the dark
Middle Ages of Europe? Rather than shedding
tears and lamenting the lost paradise of Andalusia,
our real duty is to introduce this great civilization
to the whole world in all its aspects. It is to showcase the era when Andalusia was at the pinnacle
in every field. While the people of Paris, Vienna,
and Rome could only venture out into the streets
at night with torches, the people of Cordoba
roamed the brightly lit streets in safety until late
hours. While Europe was unfamiliar with cleanliness, Cordoba boasted a staggering 800 public
baths. Clean water networks reached into people’s
homes. While European palaces had only around
70-80 books, the library of Caliph Al-Hakam II
contained a whopping 400,000 volumes. The first
paper factory in Europe was established in Xàtiva,
producing paper in bulk and exporting it worldwide.
When you learn about the lifestyle of Cordoba, not
only Europe’s but one of the world’s most important
centers of knowledge a millennium ago, you will be
amazed.
