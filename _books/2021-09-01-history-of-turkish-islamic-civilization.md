The fact that Turks found themselves in a vast
geography where Islam had spread, thanks to the
sincere efforts of nations that had embraced this
religion before them, is noteworthy. It is well known
that after embracing Islam, Turks embarked on a
process of constructing a new history, culture, and
civilization by blending their pre-Islamic cultural,
civil, and social accumulation and some values
with Islamic values. During this process, Turks,
through the new states they established with a new
spirit, identity, and dynamism, opened up to the
world. They integrated love and faith, justice and
fairness, tolerance and reason, and valued knowl-
edge and scientific research, assuming a con-
structive and proactive role on the stage of history.
Consequently, they succeeded in becoming part
of a universal civilization. This modest work aims
to present, with examples to some extent, both the
place of Turks who entered the circle of Islamic
civilization through the acceptance of Islam and the
institutions and social organizations they estab-
lished to serve other nations and societies. It seeks
to convey to the younger generations and readers.
