Yavuz Sultan Selim is one of the most powerful,
far-sighted, and great sultans of the Ottoman Empire. His accomplishments, victories, and successes achieved in a short period are extraordinary.
Like his grandfather Fatih Sultan Mehmed, Yavuz
showed great respect to scholars and increased
his knowledge by reading books day and night,
also excelling in his artistic abilities and leaving
behind memorable poems. Through establishing
peace and unity in Anatolia, winning the battles of
Çaldıran and Ridaniye, annexing the Southeastern provinces to the Ottoman Empire, and incorporating Arab Islamic countries into the imperial
territories, as well as conquering the territories of
Syria and Egypt, he demonstrated himself as a
world emperor. Despite his short life span of 50
years and a reign of only 8 years, Yavuz, during his
reign, revitalized the Ottoman Empire and earned it
the leadership of the “Islamic world.” You will read
about Yavuz’s life through the pen of Talip Arışahin. In this work, the author narrates Yavuz’s life
from his birth, childhood, adolescence, education,
mentors, princehood, to his physical and spiritual
portrait along with his strong personality. Yavuz,
who quelled rebellions, suppressed uprisings, and
halted the activities of centers of discord with his
powerful character, is found to attach great value to
the institution of ‘Caliphate’ he brought to the Ottomans, expressed by the phrase “Hâdim’ül Haremeyn” (Servant of the Two Holy Mosques).
