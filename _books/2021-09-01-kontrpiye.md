It’s the story of Giray, who always dreamed of
being known as the best forward in the world when
he was young and of being a son who didn’t em-
barrass his family. By the age of 26, when he looks
back, he sees that he has achieved a large part
of his dreams. At least he is the forward of a club
that is at the bottom of the amateur league, and his
father still hasn’t disowned him.
However, when he meets Sara one day while
spending time with his friends Ismail and Toner, sit-
ting under an electric pole eating sunflower seeds,
not only his dreams but his whole life changes.
And Giray’s real story begins from then on. Is it a
platonic love story for him? Or will it end up being a
marriage where they will complain while looking at
the same electricity bill, saying, “Wow! Is Pikachu
living in this house?”
The story of Giray and Sara is a love story that
will outshine Kerem and Aslı, Leyla and Mecnun,
and Ciguli and Binnaz. Alongside adventure, love,
football, comedy, and many other topics are cov-
ered in this book...
It’s the perfect time to start “Kontrpiye” so you
won’t miss out!
