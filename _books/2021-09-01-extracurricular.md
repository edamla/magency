Being inside the school, being inside the office,
being inside popular culture... “Being inside” inherently implies being limited, and as long as a person
remains “inside,” they are bound to confine their
potential within these existing worlds. To liberate
and become unique, one needs to step outside of
these boundaries.
“Okuldışı” is a book of liberation narrated by a
writer who has fallen off the horse many times on
this path, despite all the pessimism, troubles, and
difficulties, and tells young people that “there is another way” despite all the challenges. This book is
a youth manifesto that claims the solution to many
problems seen in our education system lies outside
of school.
