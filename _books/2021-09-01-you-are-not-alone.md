The issue of the headscarf, which is occasionally forced into Turkey’s agenda, has been one of
the most talked-about and debated issues in our
country over the past half century. In reality, it is a
fundamental religious issue and the right to wear
it, but it has been politicized by some groups and
attempted to be taken to other platforms. Despite
the laws enacted by our state today, which have
brought the right for people to dress and believe
as they wish, the issue is still being reheated and
brought back into the forefront by some. Master
writer Üstün İnanç has extraordinarily portrayed
this issue in his novel “You Are Not Alone” and
extensively addressed the topic. The film adaptation of the novel, which has garnered great
interest from our society, has also been brought
to the silver screen by Mesut Uçakan, reaching
a wide audience. The novel, revolving around a
fundamental religious issue, actually addresses
the modernization story, quests, contradictions,
and intellectual struggles between Western culture
and Islamic civilization of our past half-century.
“You Are Not Alone,” brought to our cultural life by
Mihrabad Publications’ 32nd edition, is an excellent
novel that has the power to eliminate the premature judgments of many people who have fallen
into different views.
