A love story set against the backdrop of life,
struggling to hold onto love and faith: “...During
these conversations, Ali was breaking out in a cold
sweat. He had never felt so helpless and utterly
alone before. He had learned life with all its bit-
ter aspects, just as his father had said, even at
this young age. He started to worry more about
his family, even about Zeynep. If what the village
guard Şehmus had said came true and any harm
came to his loved ones, he would die of grief. How
could he justify himself alone if so many people
testified against him?...” With its fluent language
and captivating style, readers will breeze through
“Kuş Köprü.” This work, which portrays the Anato-
lian climate and the simple lives of our people, is
actually our own story.
