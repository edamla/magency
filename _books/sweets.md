Künefe is so excited that day... She doesn’t know what will
happen to her, who she will meet, or how her day will go. Probably because of excitement, he gets cramps in his stomach and
he doesn’t feel well at all. I wonder if he lay in his warm bed or
turned into a statue, stood still and no one noticed him...
But nooooo! Since Künefe is a brave kitty, she overcomes her
excitement and fears and has a wonderful day with the help of
her heart full of goodness. How Does? Come on, join Künefe’s
adventures and see with your own eyes!
