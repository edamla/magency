This book, resulting from Orhan Toker’s extensive research and acquired experiences over the
years, serves as a guide for parents raising children in the digital world. Being a parent in such a
world is both confusing and challenging. On one
hand, there is an immense digital world that occupies a significant place in our lives due to the
necessities of the age. On the other hand, there
are children who get lost in the corridors due to
the misuse of this world or sometimes due to our
neglect, leaving helpless parents who are unsure
of what to do between these two situations.
The book you are holding focuses precisely on
how to strike a balance between these two aspects. “Being a Parent in the Digital World” provides information on how our children, who open
their eyes to such a world, can become healthy
individuals in it. It also serves as a reliable companion for the parents who guide them on this
magnificent journey with the proper attention, love,
and care they offer. Let us not forget that “Nothing
is more valuable in the world than children!”
