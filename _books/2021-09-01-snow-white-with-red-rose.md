Red Rose and Snow White are two sisters with
different personalities. Despite their differences, they
get along very well and live a beautiful life in the
forest with their mother.
One winter night, when Red Rose opens the door,
she finds a large furry bear asking for a warm place
to sleep! At first, the mother and daughters are terrified, but they realize the bear is harmless and they
befriend him, playing delightful games with him on
winter nights.
When spring arrives, the cute bear warns them
about a thieving dwarf before leaving. Later, while
wandering in the forest, Red Rose and Snow White
encounter a dwarf whose beard is caught in a tree.
Could this dwarf be the little man the bear warned
them about before leaving?
