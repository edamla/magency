This book challenges the validity of a secularization-centered historiography by addressing
existing theses on Islam and Secularism. In this
“secularization narrative” secularism is perceived
as a progressive and advanced stage. This narrative can only be evaluated by placing secularism
as an actor at the center of the story. But there are
different perspectives from different corners of the
world that reveal a variety of historical possibilities.
Indicators measuring the level of secularization
are all based on the visibility or invisibility of religious symbols and practices. The author makes a
psychological and political interpretive contribution
to analyzes of secularization by drawing attention
to possible secular motivations behind overtly religious appearances or religious motivations that do
not bear any visible religious symbols. Sometimes
most religious behavior hides purely worldly motives and intentions, and vice versa.
Based on these contributions, the author argues
that the processes of religiosity and worldliness
should be understood from a cyclical perspective,
not with a historical evolution narrative.
