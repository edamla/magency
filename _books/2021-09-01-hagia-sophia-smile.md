The journey of a temple that has survived
through the 17th century and reached our present day is equipped with a struggle against time.
After the first two were destroyed in earthquakes,
Hagia Sophia, rebuilt for the third time, has managed to maintain its central role in humanity’s
sense of refuge until today. The fate of such a
monument, which opened on December 27, 537,
and witnessed significant events for 1483 years
until our present day, has not been the same as
that of the nation that created it. Because while
the Byzantine Empire that built it has fallen, Hagia Sophia has not. Alongside the extraordinary
events that occurred with the birth of our Prophet
in 571, the dome of Hagia Sophia was also shaken and cracked by an earthquake. Finally, with
the announcement of “Ni’mel Ceyş,” the conquest
took place, and Hagia Sophia was illuminated with
the word of unity. This book, which addresses the
religious and political events surrounding Hagia
Sophia from Byzantium to the present day, is a
documentary novel that tells the stories of tears
and smiles of this temple. Our publishing house
takes pride in presenting the first of the “HAGIA
SOPHIA LIBRARY” series, which will support this
blessed cause.
