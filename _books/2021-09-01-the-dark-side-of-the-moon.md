They didn’t mean to have an adventure or fun. They were filled with excitement of discovering a new planet
to settle. Will Spacecraft Irus 8011 make it happen? Will Captain Aka make it happen by the help of his talented
and smart crew? Will the folks in the spacecraft get along with each other? Will the ecosystem garden be
enough for their needs?
Where will the shockwaves drag them into? How will the results of this adventure affect them? Will these
folks who lived on different planets and went through many hardships find a new place to live? The civilization
of Irus, on the dark side of the moon, will take you to places that you have never been or heard of before and
will drag you into an ultimate adventure...
