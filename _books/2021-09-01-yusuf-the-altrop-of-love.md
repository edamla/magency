They said; Oh Zuleikha, speak quickly, who is
this? A Saba breeze or a gentle breeze! She kept
silent, those who knew said; Yes, we know! Do you
think it’s a storm of love; The seas sing its song,
the SURA narrates its lesson. If we could grasp
it, if we could stand before it, it is Yusuf! Clearly;
Yusuf was the sanctuary of eternal love and wild
passion; His father loved him dearly, they threw
him into the well. Zuleikha fell in love with him, they
imprisoned her. He only loved his LORD, That’s
true LOVE; He placed the throne of sovereignty
beneath his feet and made him the most distinguished Statesman in the world!
