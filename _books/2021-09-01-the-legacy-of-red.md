This fairy tale tells a story that resonates with people of all ages. In a fractured world where people retreat
into their own enclosed realms bordered by high walls, it emphasizes the importance of communal living.
Additionally, it imagines a world where animals and humans coexist. The story explores universal themes such
as courage, trust, the longing for home, and friendship. According to legend, there was a time when everyone
could understand each other; however, when languages became mixed, this became impossible. The main
character, Red, never loses his courage and hope as he ventures into unknown territories after losing his
homeland. Eventually, he succeeds in returning home by establishing a new homeland with his friends.
