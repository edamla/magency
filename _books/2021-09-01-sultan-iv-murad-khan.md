Murad Khan had a solid bone structure like an
elephant and also a fiery spirit. He was jumping
from one running horse to another, and the javelin
he was throwing went like an arrow from a bow.
His arrows fell farther than a rifle bullet, and it was
said that he pierced iron plates with his arrow.
The Shah of India, Hurrem, sent him a shield
made of elephant ears and covered with rhino skin.
His ambassador said, “My Sultan, a rifle and sword
will not affect this.” When he said that, he hit his
spear and pierced the armor.
The sultan put five hundred gold in that shield
and gave it to the ambassador. He took it to the
place where the Indian Sultan had come to hang it
on the palace door.
