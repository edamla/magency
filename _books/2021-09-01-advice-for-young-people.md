This work, which contains the two treatises “O
Son” and “Ten Rules” by Imam al-Ghazali, addresses the establishment of a society composed
of individuals adorned with moral virtues and discusses the things to be done and avoided.
“O Son,” focusing more on the application rather
than theoretical ethics, emerged as a sincere initiative of one of Imam al-Ghazali’s students who was
concerned about the afterlife, and it received immense attention from all circles. The main reason
for this interest is undoubtedly his addressing of “O
son!” which actually encompasses all young people, and young readers find much of themselves in
the work.
Similarly, the treatise named “Ten Rules” outlines
the indispensable principles that a believer must
adhere to, providing almost a formula that facilitates the trade for the afterlife for those who come
to the world.
Despite being of a size that can be easily read,
this work holds great significance as it contains
clues to profound truths.
