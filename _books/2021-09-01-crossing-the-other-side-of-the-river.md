“Many children waited for their fathers for days,
but they never came. Many mothers waited for
their sons. Many sisters waited for their brothers.
Many wives waited for their husbands. Many girls
waited for their lovers... But they never came.”
In her collection of 19 stories, Samira Osmanbegović-Bakšić brings to light the mercilessness of
war by narrating the firsthand experiences of those
who lived through it. The stories shed light on aspects of the war that we are not familiar with, such
as children in orphanages being sold to Italians for
adoption or Bosnian prisoners of war ending up in
Serbian Hospitals, where they faced torture instead
of receiving treatment. These are just a few facets
of the war that remain unknown.
Despite enduring every form of oppression and
pain, these heroic individuals managed to endure
and succeed in crossing to the other side of the
river – their stories of resilience and survival.
