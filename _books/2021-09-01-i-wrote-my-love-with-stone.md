One of the most important factors that enriches
our enlightenment and knowledge is the heritage
from our past. In this respect, our history is filled
with materials that we will proudly remember. However, because we always look forward, we have
not understood the efforts and sacrifices of the
people who prepared our future with their endeavors in the past enough. This unfortunate neglect
has been prevalent in every field, from theology to
literature, from sociology to architecture, from medicine to astronomy. We have now entered a period
where we realize that it will be difficult to move forward without the rich accumulation of the past. In
this regard, there are certainly countless names to
consider. When we look at architecture within this
focus, one of the most important names we should
focus on is undoubtedly Mimar Sinan. If we need
to examine the picture of what an Anatolian child
brought to the country through his recruitment to
the Palace, then it is necessary to grasp the hidden
details of Sinan’s life. If he became the ‘Chief Architect of the Ottoman State’ at the age of 50, then
it is of great benefit for us to know very well the
source from which this gem was brewed and the
dough from which it was kneaded, and the oven in
which it was baked. This work in your hands is a
distinguished product narrated in novel style, born
from the soil of Sinan by a Writer, Muhsin İlyas
Subaşı, after a long and exhaustive research and
examination of his works, accumulated in his other
two books about Sinan.
