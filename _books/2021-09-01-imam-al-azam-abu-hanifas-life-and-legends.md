Great imam... Great leader, great scholar... Imam
means leader. As in the front at the al-tar, it means
the one who is at the beginning of every good
deed.
Here is Imam-i Azam Abu Hanifa: The judge, the
judge who takes care of every problem of the people... The leader with his sharp mind and appearance... The educator who teaches by endearing,
who is wellversed in the scien-ce of psychology,
and the scholar who knows science and its resources very well...
Even the title of distinguished professor, whose
scientific identity is known today, does not fully express him. Abu Yusuf, one of the students trained
by Abu Hanifa, said: “I would give half of my wealth
to a scholar council of Abu Hanifa.” How well this
word expresses his divine pleasure in the lesson
circle.
