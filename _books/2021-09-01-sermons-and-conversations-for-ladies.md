A woman is an important and valuable human
being. How important they are, is better understood from the hadith-i sharif “Paradise laid under
your feet”.
The woman is the mother. The woman is the
first guide who creates, educates and directs the
generation. Since the task of raising a generation
is the most important job of women, they must be
knowledgeable, cultured and, above all, faithful.
There were no prophets from women, but many
female saints set an example for men.
The female scholars, who trained many Isla-mic
scholars, are remembered for their unique studies,
even on Islamic jurisprudence. The women who
were interested in science, walking in the footsteps
of our mother Aisha, shed light on humanity.
