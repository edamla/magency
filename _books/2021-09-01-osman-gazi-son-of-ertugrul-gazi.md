Osman Gazi, the son of Ertuğrul Gazi, is the
founder of a great state from the Kayı Tribe that
spread over three continents. This glorious Oghuz
Bey, who duly protected the trust he received from
his father and the Seljuks, worked diligently to
glorify Ila’i Kalimatullah, that is, the name of Allah,
and to spread the true religion, Islam, and laid the
foundations of the Ottoman Empire, which would
survive for six centuries. Osman Gazi, who set
an example for all world leaders today and laid
the foundations of a great civilization, provided an
environment of justice, tolerance, tranquility and
peace for Muslims as well as non-Muslims in the
lands he conquered, and presented a magnificent
state model to all humanity. While Mihrabat Publi-
cations presents to the readers this valuable work
of Cavit Ersen, titled Osman Gazi, written in a grip-
ping style and in fluent Turkish, it aims to contrib-
ute to the awakening historical consciousness in
society and the ever expanding love of ancestors
in young generations.
