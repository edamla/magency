Our Noble Prophet implemented the new spirit
and dynamism brought by Islam and left us his
duty forever as a trust of faith with his preaching,
which became a means of salvation for all humanity. The Four Caliphs who succeeded him fulfilled
this sacred trust with honor. In the first century of
Islam, the Umayyads who came after the Four
Caliphs subjected many Muslims, including the beloved grandsons of the Prophet, Hasan and Hussein, to unspeakable atrocities. In such a darkness
of oppression, the divine wisdom manifested, and
Umar bin Abdulaziz, who restored the light and justice of Islam, became the caliph. The main reason
why he is rightfully referred to as the ‘5th Caliph’
or ‘Second Umar’ in Islamic history is his re-establishment of just governance in accordance with the
Quran and Sunnah. This work in your hands is the
novel of this Honorable Man, who greatly contributed to the advancement of Islam beyond the dirty
wheel of political intrigues during his short caliphate period, achieving great deeds.
