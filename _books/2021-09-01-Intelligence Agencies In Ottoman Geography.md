Why “Jerusalem 1917”? Because Jerusalem
and the Al-Aqsa Mosque are the places where
our beloved Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
him) ascended to during the Night Journey. It is
the first qibla of Muslims. With the conquest by Hz.
Omar (may Allah be pleased with him), it became
the sacred city entrusted to all Muslims. Why is
the year 2017, declared as the Year of Jerusalem,
important? Because: it marks the 1380th anniversary of the conquest of Jerusalem by the Islamic
Army Commander sent by Hz. Omar, Abu Ubaidah
ibn al-Jarrah, in 637; the 830th anniversary of
the liberation of the city from the Crusaders by
the Conqueror of Jerusalem, Sultan Saladin, in
1187; the 500th anniversary of the incorporation of
Jerusalem into Ottoman rule by the First Ottoman
Caliph, Sultan Selim I, in 1517; the 100th anniversary of the British occupation of Jerusalem on
December 9, 1917, during the First World War; and
the 50th anniversary of Israel declaring Jerusalem
as its capital by occupying the entire city on June
7, 1967. How did the “lost sacred lands” slip from
our hands a century ago? Who made deals behind
closed doors? Which espionage organizations
significantly influenced the outcome of this war?
Which commanders fought heroically, and which
ones led to defeat on the battlefields? You will
find the answers to all these questions in the book
“Jerusalem 1917”. You will learn about the sacrifices of unnamed heroes and the unimaginable
hardships of the Gaza-Jerusalem-Palestine front,
and you will remember our heroic ancestors with
mercy.
