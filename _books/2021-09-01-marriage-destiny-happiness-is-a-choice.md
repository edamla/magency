Many marriages today resemble a game of
pretend played by adults. This game of pretend
often distances spouses from their marital duties.
Unfortunately, these childish attitudes that arise
in relationships often do not lead to any solutions
between partners, ultimately resulting in the breakdown of many marriages due to resolvable issues.
It’s the children caught in the middle who suffer the
most in these situations...
So why does this happen? Is marriage really
just a game of pretend? Isn’t it time to realize that
growing up, behaving like adults, and understanding that marriage is a lifelong journey?
Do you think it’s not yet time to take on the responsibilities that life, marriage, being a spouse,
and having children bring?
The book in your hands provides answers to
many such questions. With its simple and easily
understandable language, it not only addresses all
the questions that come to mind when it comes to
marriage for married couples and those considering marriage but also provides important insights in
every line.
For those intending to embark on the path of
adulthood and understanding the nature of marriage to take an important step, the book has a lot
to say...
