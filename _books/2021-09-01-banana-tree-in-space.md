The little monkey named HAM, living in the forest, was different from his friends. He
didn’t communicate with anyone and didn’t follow any rules. He was especially famous
for throwing banana peels on the ground with a pat pat. Those who kept slipping on
these peels were tired of him. When HAM made the lion king angry by making him slip
on banana peels, he was expelled from the forest. He found himself in various places,
and then inside a rocket launched into space. So, what will HAM, feeling hungry in
space, eat? Will he be able to return to Earth? What adventure awaits him? This story,
inspired by the life of HAM, the first monkey sent into space, shows the power of love
and friendship in understanding and accepting differences. Nothing is as it seems.
Being understood is the most beautiful thing in the world.
