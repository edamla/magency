LOVE and CONVERSATION...
Two human beauties we are beginning to forget...
Conversation is born from love,
Love continues and flourishes through conversa-
tion.
Hearts devoid of love remain devoid of conversa-
tion,
Environments without conversation become arid,
barren, lifeless.
Love and conversation without family are incom-
plete, lacking,
Love and conversation begin, develop, and expand
within the family first.
The most suitable ground for love and conversa-
tion is the family,
The family is the final stronghold of love and con-
versation.
In his book “Love and Conversations in the Family,”
Vehbi Vakkasoğlu discusses the values that make
a family a family in a conversational warmth. The
book provides information on various topics ranging
from how parents should treat their children to envi-
ronmental consciousness, from religious knowledge
to social needs.
In this book, each topic is kept to a length that can
be read in 15 minutes, aiming for families to come
together and converse for at least 15 minutes
every day.
