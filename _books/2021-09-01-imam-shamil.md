“O General! Inform your Tsar: In the heart of the
Caucasus, there are thousands of other fortresses
like Aulgo and tens of thousands of Surhay towers
have taken their place. All of these are waiting for
those who rebelled against their Lord and thirst
for their death. I have already healed the three
wounds inflicted on my body by your weapons with
the medicines I have made from the healing herbs
of Dagestan, and I have prepared to fight against
you. I have already dedicated my remaining children as a sacrifice to the country and the way of
Allah. We will give everything to you and your Tsar
in abundance, but never the freedom and honor of
the homeland!”
