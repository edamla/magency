My childhood and youth were filled with separation, sadness, and pains. I was someone who
never bowed down in the face of injustice. I was
fighting all the difficulties on my own and somehow
overcoming every challenge. Betrayals, dirty traps,
dark schemes couldn’t intimidate me... My life was
like a battlefield. As one struggle ended, another
began... While I was wrestling with darkness, an
unexpected bright love was born into my heart...
The most difficult trials began with that love...
Words are not enough to describe what happened

like a storm in a cistern?
