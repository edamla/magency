In the modern age the countryside is moving fast to cities. Major-
ity is living in cities, but how is the quality of life got affected about
this. The book questions this in the eye of a dog named Alabash.
This book gives the youth the love of animals, the animals that
sometimes children stone, sometimes torture, sometimes play
with, sometimes they are afraid of, but in every case they are the
precious creatures of the earth. They will realize that the human is
only a human when he loves, respects, sacrifies and when he is
faithful. In the eye of a noble Kangal, Alabash, the book shows the
value erosion during the shift from countryside to cities. It shows
another aspect of the recent migration problems.
