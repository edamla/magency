There have always been deviations from absolute truths in the history of humanity, and there
have always been people who are the epitome of
virtue, who warn people against these deviations,
and call them to the good, the truth and the beautiful.
The absolute truth is Islam, which Allah is pleased with. It was handed down from the first
human and the first prophet to our beloved Prophet
like a torch. Prophets are exemplary people chosen by Allah in order to convey the divine message
to people. There is patience, tolerance, mercy and
good news for people in their lives and struggles.
For this reason, there is a necessity for Muslims to
know the prophets.
