In this story, Emir and his friends experienced their first holy
Ramadan month. They learnt some of the traditions of this holy
month like iftar, suhur, tarawih, layla’t al-Qadr and they devoted
to mukabalah during their childhood like all of us. They are full of
happiness to be able to greet each other on this eid, full of unity
and solidarity and feel peaceful.
“THE CHILDREN OF RAMADAN”, is a book that has the spirit
of Ramadan from our childhood. Now, we leave you with Emir
and his friends’ Ramadan adventures.
