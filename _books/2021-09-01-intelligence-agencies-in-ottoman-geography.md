The dissolution and fragmentation of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled over three continents
for six centuries, and the division and colonization
of Islamic lands into small states, were initiated
by Crusader and Zionist organizations through
intelligence warfare starting 150 years ago. In this
research:
- Sultan Abdulhamid’s “Yıldız Intelligence Organization”,
- Operations and operatives of the Special Organization,
- Pre-British occupation Zionist organizations such
as Nili, Bilu, Gideon, Hashomer, etc.,
- Post-occupation Zionist organizations such as
Haganah, Irgun, Stern, etc.,
- Spies and activities of the Arab Bureau attached
to the British Intelligence Service,
- In addition to well-known spies like Lawrence and
Gertrude Bell,
- Stories of lesser-known British spies like Aubrey
Herbert, Charles Noel, Irvine Shakespear have
been examined.
While reading about the lives and intrigues of
these spies from a century ago, you will marvel
and learn with amazement that similar games are
still being played today.
