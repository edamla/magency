This book presents pearls from the life of the
first mother of Islam. She is the mother who is the
greatest example of an Islamic woman. She was
brought up in such an era and time that the world
was on fire that day.
The brooks of the world were filled with polytheists, and sin and immorality became fashionable.
Bloody feet were walking overhead, innocents
were moaning.
You will think as you read the life of the first wife
and the first Muslim that will amaze your mind and
bite your lips. You’ll shudder when you think about
it. Many unseen pearls will fill your heart and your
eyes will be filled with tears for a long time…
