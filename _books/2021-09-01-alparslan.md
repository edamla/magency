After the Friday prayer in the Malazgirt Plain, all
the soldiers said goodbye to each other. Alparslan
was wearing a white dress. Turning to his soldiers,
he said:
“My soldiers! There is no sultan but Allah here.
Command and destiny are entirely in His hands.

martyred here, let this dress be my shroud and
bury me where I was shot.” After this speech, the
soldiers excitedly said, “We will never leave your
command!” they cried. And Alparslan, drawing the
sword, said, “Bismillah!” He rode his horse like
lightning against the Byzantine army.
