The Almighty Creator has characterized humanity as the most perfect of His creations and has
ordained LIFE as a temporary and mysterious play,
moreover; regulated as a waiting period with a
known end, with “Freedom of Choice” within it. In
other words; “You are human, live like a human!”
we’ve been told! Look around, Joys are like a
mountain in this life, while sorrows are deep wells.
You, descending boat, ascending boat, are bewildered here! Yet, if a person could be a bucket;
Firstly, filling it with the covenant of FAITH, and
shouting “PRAYER is the sustenance of life!” Then
it’s easy; Perceiving love as the sea, with the sky
as its foam, will color your life with it. Those who
do not see tomorrow will not have the strength to
live today!.. However, the tomorrows will belong to
those who turn GRAVEL STONES into gems. Here
lies the whole SECRET!.
