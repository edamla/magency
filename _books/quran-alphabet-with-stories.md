The best way of teaching Quran for the pre-school children is to
simplify the language and make the teaching enjoyable by games
and stories. So, we used narrative technique and letters as a
way of game. The similarities and cartoon characters were used
to remember the letters and syllables easily. Initially, the sound
of the letters should be learned by letter cards. The pictures that
symbolize the sound are necessary to make connection between
letters and pictures. After learning all the letters, you can pass to
part “syllables”. Your learning process is completed by exercises,
stickers and verbal motivation support. We wish our book would be
the first step to learn and live Quran.
