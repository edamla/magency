Our storybook series “From Life” consisting of 3
volumes has been read by millions of people for
half a century. Later, it was translated into 10 foreign languages and won the hearts of those people
as well. Since these works appeal to people of “all
ages” from 7 to 77, in the book you have in your
hands, we have brought together the stories that
we wrote “only for adults” making a different move.
Presented with love and prayers.
