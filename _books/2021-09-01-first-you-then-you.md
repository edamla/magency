First you, then you,
You are like a dream deeply embedded within me,
O beloved...
Clouds carry love from border to border,
The news of conquest is heard far and wide on the
horizon.
The veil of longing is lifted between me and Istanbul,
Ships made of folded paper carry hope to the harbors filled with joyful tidings...
Colorful hopes bloom in my soul with you, like a
rainbow,
I wait patiently, for this longing has been my legacy
for so long.
As if a tale and a dream are etched into my heart
from words and verses,
Every fiber of my being carries your name to insurmountable walls...
With every breath, I feel the urge to shout my love
for you,
Either I must have you or you must understand,
please...
Words get stuck in my throat as I look at you,
First you, then you,
You are like a dream deeply embedded within me,
O beloved...
