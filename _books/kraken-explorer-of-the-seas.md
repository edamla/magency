Ships, submarines, and even diving fishmen are disappearing one by one.
No one can explain why. Because those who go to investigate never return.
The famous oceanographer Prof. Celalettin and his team set out to unravel
this mystery with research ships named Kraken. The Kraken, named after
the mythological sea monster, is equipped with state-of-the-art submarines.
Our heroes board these submarines and decide to dive deep into the ocean
to solve the mystery of the mysterious disappearances. Will they be able to
solve this mystery? What if they disappear too? What lies beneath the sea?
Why is no one returning? Could there be different life forms under the sea?
The answers to all these questions are hidden in this book. Come on, if you
can’t resist your curiosity, open the cover of this book too...
