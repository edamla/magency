When Sayyid Bereket appeared before Timur
and met with him, he had no doubt that he would
have a bright future and he clearly expressed this.
Time had already begun to speed up to show how
right he was in his words about the young leader
Timur.
Amir Timur’s achievements were not just the
words of fire spoken about him. A chess master
like him used rare tactics in his moves against his
enemies, knoc-king them down where they least
expected it.
While this book was being prepared, the most
ancient works written about Emir Timur were not
only scanned, but also the depths of the Asian
continent and between the lines of many essen-
tial works on the history of the nations that lived
in the Asian steppes such as Mongols, Turks,
and Kipchaks were consulted. Old Turkish idioms
and proverbs; This novel, which makes important
touches on cultural elements such as clothing,
eating and drinking, and sitting down, will add
innovations to both the ideas and vocabulary of the
readers.
