The bed and room are considered tidy. She
doesn’t seem to have much in the way of clothing
other than her lilac pajamas, which she takes off in
the morning and throws on the bed. The note on
the little table terrifies me: “Your end has come, T!”
We both stare at him in horror. There’s a big
cross drawn on yesterday’s post. Underneath it
says “You’re not here anymore.” There is no knifelike object anywhere that our eyes can reach. We
ask each other if the note and the missing knife are
related.
As the Pi-Chi-Di team, one of us has to continue
school, one of us has to sprain an ankle, and one
of us has to face the score!
I seem to be the last one to enter the amphitheater. As I ran backwards, I felt like everyone was
turning and looking at me. I can tell it’s because of
the weight of the bags I carry, but they don’t know
that there’s more weight in my heart than those
bags. If only they knew his burden! Oh, if only they
knew!
