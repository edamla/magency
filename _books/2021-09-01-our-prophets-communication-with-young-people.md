What is adolescence? Did prophets experience
adolescent crisis? Did the Prophet of Allah (peace
be upon him) face youth difficulties? Did those
around him experience adolescent crisis? Can individuals with different characteristics be disciplined
with the same educational method? Is there a
personalized educational method? Which attributes
are reflected in education? According to which pedagogy do we educate our children? How much do
we know about the pedagogy of the Sunnah? Can
parents act as a barrier in education? Is adolescence a biological state? Why is the same situation
not observed in everyone? Is the foundation of the
burning and destructive passage of adolescence
encountering the first sin of the youth? While science considers adolescence problematic, how did
the Prophet of Allah entrust the greatest responsibilities to adolescents at this age? What does
modern pedagogy fail to see? The communication
of our Prophet with the youth provides answers to
these and many more questions. To avoid problems in our children’s education, we incorporate
‘Sunnah pedagogy’ into our lives.
