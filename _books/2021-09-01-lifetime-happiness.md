Everyone needs happiness. Every man and
woman want to be happy at home. This is quite
natural. The important thing is to live life consciously. As I receive calls from many countries abroad,
all the way to the United Sta-tes, there are also
people calling from Turkey, even coming to visit me
for advice on family problems. Before marriage, it
is a proud beha-vior for our young girls to consult
ideas and get information about a peaceful home,
espe-cially in preparation for marriage. This work
has been prepared in order to lead our young people who are in such a quest.
