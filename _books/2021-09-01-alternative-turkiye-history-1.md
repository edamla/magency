You have read the stories of the winners in textbooks...
Memorized the dates of great wars, the clauses
of treaties...
The exam questions came from the parts you
were responsible for in the books...
But what about the stories of the losers?
What happened to the people caught in between
during all those great wars, treaties, and regime
changes? The headlines that never made it to the
front page, the news squeezed into columns; what
were they actually trying to tell us?
This book tells the stories of the places you were
not held accountable for in history exams.
The book is open; you can start from wherever
you want.
