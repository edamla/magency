The King has promised a great
reward to anyone who can solve
the mystery of his twelve daughters, whose shoes are found worn
out every night. Many princes who
attempted to solve the mystery have
disappeared the next day.
Michael also sets out to uncover the
secret of the princesses. Following
the advice of an old woman he meets
on the way, he starts working as a
gardener at the palace and begins to
watch over the princesses.
As Michael secretly follows the princesses, he travels through enchanted
forests and reaches a grand palace.
Falling in love with Princess Lina,
Michael must find a way to solve the
mystery and marry his beloved princess without falling under the same
enchantment as the other princes.
