The Quran, as a Mushaf, is right next to us, but
when it comes to “women’s rights,” we are far from
it. Despite being the living example of the Quran,
the Messenger of Allah exhibited the utmost respect for women, yet, with fabricated narrations,
“the better half of the society” continues to be
mistreated.
Young people! Would you like to marry a man
you have never seen and do not want? Women!
Would you accept being called “inauspicious”?
Men! Aren’t women the cause of temptation? Who
will enter hell first? Are the majority of those who
will enter Paradise men or women? Do men have
the right to divorce while women don’t? The pressure to prevent women from education! The claim
that men and women are created from different
substances! Accusations of “betrayal” against
women through Eve! The answers to many more
questions and doubts are in this book.
