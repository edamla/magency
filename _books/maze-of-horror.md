course during the summer break. While they are diving they meet
with the sharks and accidentally seek refuge in an undersea cave.
However that cave is not a place to refuge at all. Four friends who
enter through a door that suddenly opens; they find themselves in a
labyrinth of mystery and fear. There was an invisible one or ones in
this labyrinth constantly play games to these teens. What do teens
encounter in this horror labyrinth? Who are those who play these
games? Are teens able to get out of this labyrinth?
“this is it.”
