In this book, we will take a trip through his-tory in
chronological order. First, “Who is Hazrat Ali? What
did he do? What is the scientific degree? How did
he make a note in history?” We will try to make an
analysis after investigating and examining such issues. Let’s also point out that people’s religious beliefs, thoughts, ideas and comments, and political
stances do not concern us much. It is our duty to
respect everyone’s opinion (if there is no excess).
However, Since the life of Ali (ra) is intertwined with
the Messenger of Allah (saas), we will try to witness the journey of these two great people without
separating them from each other while writing this
work. Neither our tongues nor our pen will be silent
against those who have deviated from the ba-sic
principles laid down by Allah, the path of Sirat-i
Mustakim drawn by the Messenger of Allah, whose
aim is not religion, and who try to destroy the true
religion of Islam. We will try to do the guiding task
to the end.
