“Journey Towards the Burning Ember Within Fa-
tih” This book is filled with boats passing through,
filled with scholars. It identifies the golden rings
that intertwine geographies like a necklace. It sets
sail towards a vast horizon that combines the pas-
sion for maps with inner world technology. For the
author, the substance of Fatih and his conquests
is as important, perhaps even more so, than what
they express. What was this young Sultan looking
for in the legendary library of the Byzantine Emper-
or? And why did he have the biography of Plutarch,
the oracle of the Delphi temple, transcribed? What
void did he expect the wisdom in the dozens of
commentaries on Fusus al-Hikam to fill? We don’t
know enough about these. What we do know is
that there is a fire burning within him. If this book
can bring the reader even one step closer to that
ember, it will have largely fulfilled its duty.
