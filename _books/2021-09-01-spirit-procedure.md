Side by side, we are alone...
In the very center of the world...
...
In fact, we all resemble each other. And yet, we
are all so different from one another. We speak
the same language, but we can’t meet in the same
sentences. Our bodies may look alike, but our
shadows are different. The things that make us
similar also separate us from each other. Side by
side, we are. Each of us and none of us. None of
us and all of us...
...
When we are born, millions of minutes are given
to us. As we live, we find ourselves face to face
with slippery millions of minutes. As the minutes
diminish, we become more and more helpless. No
matter how much we resist, we can’t stop this crazy disappearance. We are afraid. And side by side,
we stand. Now...
And forever...
