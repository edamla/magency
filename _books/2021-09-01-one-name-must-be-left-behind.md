The value of reading history becomes clearer as
you age. Lessons extracted from the past are crucial for those who heed experience. Because wise
individuals know that everything has a beginning...
Wouldn’t it be easier to approach and evaluate
newly discovered information as informed individuals and to reach solutions for our own discoveries?
We say that ideas are the sole factor that develops
a person. But could your work, which may serve
as a gateway for blessings and prayers, be considered worthless? Remember! A name should
remain behind... A benefit should touch humanity
and the future. And your discovery, molded with
sincerity and affection, should guide those who
walk the path. What did Cezeri say? Any untested
knowledge hangs somewhere between right and
wrong... Let’s try together, let’s discover together.
