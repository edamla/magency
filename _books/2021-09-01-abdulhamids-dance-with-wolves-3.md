Mustafa Armağan’s book “The Last Sultan’s
Dance with Wolves” rewrites Ottoman history,
portraying Sultan Abdulhamid II’s 33-year struggle
to navigate a country surrounded by internal and
external threats. The issue of dividing the Sick
Man’s inheritance emerged in the 1850s, and after
a heavy defeat against Russia in 1878, imperialism’s appetite grew, leading to multiple coups
in Turkey. Sultan Abdulhamid faced threats from
foreign powers upon ascending the throne. Despite
imminent collapse, he initiated a 30-year effort to
modernize the country, focusing on projects rang-ing from railways to education. Though labeled the
“Red Sultan” for his defiance against imperialism,
he made the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire
costly for Europe, turning what they thought would
be a bloodless operation into a bloody civil war,
becoming a global concern.
