In this world where appearances seek the essence, understanding the words written on the
back of a photograph and describing the first thing
we see in the sea of dreams leaves behind a
winding and fragile trace of the transience of where
we stand. We can try to understand how much
our soul reflects on our appearance, our body, by
looking at ourselves from the outside. This external
definition does not necessarily include a physical
space. The soul is described to have a different
time from space and objects. Understanding the
value of time may have been one of humanityâ€™s primary concerns in every era. Perhaps what we are
trying to see in photographs is how close we are to
the value of time. When questions and the answers
given are not enough, one generates new questions from the given answers, just like the expected
harvest from cultivated lands eventually returns to
seeds.
The soil collects all the dust without distinction.
Ultimately, everything will not return to its essence?
New ones... Old ones... Dots... Seeds...
Sprouts...
One should have favorite sentences, just as
they have beloved people that hold a place in their
hearts.
