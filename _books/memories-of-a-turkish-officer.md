There are people you are proud to know. For
me, Beybaba comes fi rst among these. In fact, it
is one of God’s greatest gifts to me. There are two
reasons for this. First of all, both of my grandfathers died before I was born, and he acted as a
grandfather to me. Secondly, think of a person who
is almost a century old. He lived during the reign of
Sultan Vahdettin, met Atatürk’s eyes, came within
two meters of him, and attended his funeral. When
he was born, the Republic of Turkey did not exist.
It’s living history. 6-7 September Events, II. World
War II, Menemen Incident, coups. He witnessed
the recent history of this country. More importantly,
since he was an offi cer, he traveled extensively
throughout the country. Based on the life of Muhittin Ergüneş, you will have the chance to learn what
has happened since the 1920s, how people lived,
and the history of daily life.
