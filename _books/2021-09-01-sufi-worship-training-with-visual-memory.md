The human mind remembers information through
pictures and makes it permanent. However, human
memory; While creating memory pictures by using
visual memory through schemas, concept and
mind maps, one can perceive concepts more easily and make all kinds of information more permanent. At this point, the purpose of visual memory,
which is based on schemas, concepts and mind
maps, is to activate the unique unused potential of
the brain and help it to develop it.
With visual memory techniques, people can
make sense of information by directing their consciousness and subconscious, which stores information like a hard disk, to abstract concepts.
Through visual memory based on diagrams,
concepts and mind maps, humans can actively use
their brains and make sense of the spiritual aspects of worship in a very striking way.
Sufism, which tries to build the spiritual integrity
of man, enriches man’s value system and perspective on life with different methods. This gives the
brain and intelligence a target. At this point, the
concepts and value system of Sufism strengthens
a person’s brain with new methods and also determines how he will think or how he will not think. Visual memory techniques based on diagrams, mind
and concept maps also offer people the opportunity to internalize the spiritual and mystical aspects
of worship more comfortably and more deeply.
