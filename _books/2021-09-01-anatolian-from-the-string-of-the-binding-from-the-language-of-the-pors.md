The folk poets used to wander all over Anatolia,
Tabriz, Samarkand, the lands of Urum, China, and
Maçin, contributing to the transmission of culture.
They were the ones to be consulted about the
good news from the borderlands, floods from the
valleys, fires from the forest villages, outbreaks of
diseases, grievances, oppressions, celebrations,
and weddings; epics circulated from hand to hand
like historical documents. If culture is one of the elements that make nations, then folk poets were the
caravans carrying culture. The state of the people,
the condition of the country, was inquired of them,
heard through the strings of the bağlama. “From
the Strings of the Bağlama: Anatolia in the Words
of the Poets” was written to share what was heard
from the saz of the lovers with you. Let’s become
companions through the words of the lovers together.
