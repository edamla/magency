“Masks and Faces in Ottoman History” is a pioneering work that shows how history can be made
attractive to large audiences without compromising
scientific honesty. As one reader aptly put it: ‘Let’s
see which roof you will bring down on us in this
book?’ If the roofs are so poorly constructed, it is
not the fault of the mischievous elephant hiding
among my books. “What can an elephant do if we
don’t know who built the roof over our heads and
how?”
Mustafa Armağan invites his readers to a breathless adventure in the labyrinths of history in his
book “Masks and Faces in Ottoman History”,
which is sure to cause controversy. It sheds light
on centuries-old debates such as Baltacı-Katerina
with a political analysis. He claims that the article
about fratricide attributed to Fatih was added to
the Kanunname later. He proves with evidence
that Çanakkale was actually “overtaken”. It sheds
light on the interesting relationship between Sultan
Abdülaziz and the famous composer Wagner and
reveals that Istanbul was conquered on June 7,
not May 29. Moreover, it manages to do all this in
a fluent, comfortable and literary style, paving the
way for a new approach that we have not seen in
popular history writing for a long time.
