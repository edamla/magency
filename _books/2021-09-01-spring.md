This book offers a unique perspective on the
biography of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon
him), departing from traditional chronological nar-
ratives to focus on his strategic and political dimen-
sions. The author aims to provide contemporary
relevance by examining the Prophet’s life through
the lens of strategic analysis. Drawing from Islam-
ic and non-Islamic sources, including Byzantine,
Himyarite, Iranian, and Abyssinian perspectives,
the book explores the global and economic context
in which Prophet Muhammad operated. Rather
than simply recounting his achievements, the book
seeks to establish an epistemological framework
that fosters political and strategic awareness
among modern readers, reflecting on the Prophet’s
life as a source of inspiration for navigating pres-
ent-day realities.
