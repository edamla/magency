Our grandmother, our beloved grandmother...
In fact, most of us had a grandmother by our
side; The person who sits next to us, who is our
refuge in times of trouble, who guides us with his
life experience when we need guidance. He en-
graved in our minds with the language of wisdom
that today’s strangeness is not the work of the
mind...
Our grandmothers, grandfathers, aunts and
uncles, whom we always knew, were open to the
truth even if they closed their eyes.
The grandmother in this book is exactly like
that...
Our author reaches out his hand from a corner of
the book full of proverbs, idioms, old songs, new
songs, books and photographs, just like our grand-
mother did, and asks curiously: “Is the world still
the same?” This question takes us on a journey to
completely different realms...
Are you ready for a journey with our grand-
mother, who is the embodiment of the bridge from
past to present?
Those who hide the grandmother somewhere
inside themselves... Please guide...
