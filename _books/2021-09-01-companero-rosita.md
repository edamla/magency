While standing alone in the dark cell of the prison, as days turned into years, receiving no news
from anyone, unable to talk to anyone, feeling as
though the world had drifted far away, suddenly, a
light appears, a voice, a glimmer of hope... A voice
that says, “Don’t worry...” This is the story of that
glimmer of hope.
Like a moth chasing after the light, willing to
burn, vowing not to turn back, this is the story of
Rosa, who paves the path of her journey with her
own hands, courage, and patience. It is a journey
that begins from the mountains of Peru, where
she joined the guerrillas with the hope of showing
a better future to underprivileged children, and
extends all the way to Turkey... A road that you will
read in one breath, woven with faith, love, resilience against torture, and the compassion of motherhood. It is the tale of “Compañero Rosita,” who
discovers herself and transforms from a caterpillar
into a butterfly, soaring into a different world.
“Compañero Rosita” is a documentary novel, gently and clearly narrated. It instills patience without
losing excitement, defies hardships without imprisoning tears. The determined and steadfast Rosa
has something to tell everyone.
