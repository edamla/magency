Social psychology and political psychology work
with a very different subject and methodological
knowledge, which do not aim to understand the
mental state and disorders of society. While psychiatry has theories that take into account the social
aspects of the causes and treatments of mental
illnesses, it focuses primarily on the individual (a
single person) and his disorders. Therefore, in this
context, the field that we can call “social mentality”
is the subject of all human sciences and has not
yet become the subject of any science. This deficiency is precisely why the question “the current
state of the population’s mental health or whether
it is deteriorating” is so frequently asked in friendly
conversations among mental health professionals
and in the media.
Of course, the fact that scientific knowledge does
not yet have a legitimate place does not mean that
the need for knowledge of human group behavior
has been suspended. Many scientists and thinkers are trying to produce information about human
group behavior, as if to fill this gap. The purpose of
writing this book lies precisely at this point; To emphasize that one of the defining features of human
existence is “group existence”, that this feature of
human beings is discussed separately in many
branches of the academic world, and that a holistic
approach is necessary in this context.
