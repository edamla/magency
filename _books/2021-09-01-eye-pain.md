“Words may pass, but their meaning remains
with us in a different way. So many words have
been spoken, so many sentences have been
constructed, and so many windows have been
fogged... Like trains carrying meaning, they move
steadily through the vast plains of our lives. We live
in this world for a long time, all to distill that mean-
ing... From the spoken and unspoken words...
From those spilled on a piece of paper, written
on a fogged-up window, entrusted to the depths
of memory... Thank goodness for that meaning.
Thankfully, it exists so that whenever we stum-
ble, we can hold onto the corners to avoid falling.
Some words always stay with us to preserve that
meaning, while others simply brush past. Many
things we no longer remember how we knew, were
a result of the touch of a forgotten word, lost in the
passage of time. Indeed, words, like humans, have
their own destiny.”
