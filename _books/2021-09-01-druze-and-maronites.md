“The Law of Tradition, The Justice of the Otto-
mans” offers an insightful exploration of Lebanon’s
socio-political landscape in the 19th century, focusing on the interactions between the Druze and
Maronite sectarian groups within the framework of
the Ottoman Legal System. The book examines
the historical origins of conflicts between these
groups and their enduring significance in global
politics. Through an analysis of legal and judicial
practices during Ottoman rule, it illuminates how
justice was administered in Lebanon’s mountainous regions and highlights the role of sectarianism
in shaping societal dynamics. By delving into court
cases that reached Istanbul and local judgments,
the book provides a nuanced understanding of the
coplexities of law and identity in Lebanon’s history.
Overall, it offers valuable insights into the historical
roots of contemporary challenges facing Lebanon.
