This book is not a history of football, military
history, or religious history. Unfortunately, it does
not contain specific solutions to the current problems of Turkish football either. In this work, where
we try to understand and narrate how religion, war,
and football have melted in the crucible of time,
we delve into the analysis of how the phenomenon
of the game has come to occupy the center of our
lives. Moreover, not only do we confine ourselves
to this analysis, but we also present predictions
about how the game can shape our future.
As Eugen Fink pointed out, the game is a ‘symbol-action’ that makes it possible to comprehend
life and the universe. Symbolic actions are the
product of a particular worldview and a specific
socio-cultural environment. From these theoretical
statements, it can be understood that the fundamental characteristics, strengths, and weakne to
the issues of Turkish history, culture, and sociology,
and cannot be treated independently.
If you are still continuing to read the cover, it
means you have changed your intention.
