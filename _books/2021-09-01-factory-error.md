This book is aimed at the youth who have been
constantly pointed at and admonished as either a
pride or a disgrace throughout human history, from
its very beginning until today.
Are you young; not questioning where and how
to position yourself under the burdens, scoldings,
and orders imposed on your shoulders? Are you
not wondering how to find your identity? Everyone
has something to say about you. Can you say
something about yourself?
In this book, a few words that your eyes will meet
might touch your heart. Perhaps a few lines will
shake you or us. Maybe they will shake you and
become a means for you to form your own sentences, what do you think?
