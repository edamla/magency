I had doubts about believing the first stories I
heard. After all, if so many people were dying, as a
journalist, I would have known about it. I even said,
“Journalists may not write about it if the public is
not interested, but they will definitely hear about it.”
I was wrong. I had no idea about the hardships of
the journey or the deaths in the mountains. When
I paid a little more attention, I noticed the bodies
found under the snow every spring on the border
of Van. Then the accidents, the people who died of
suffocation in vehicles...
But no news mentioned the deaths on Mount
Müşkül. This mountain had become the grave
of tens of thousands of people. This book tells
the stories of Afghan people, how and why they
came to Turkey, what they think, and their journey.
Besides an academic summary, it includes the
stories of 13 Afghan individuals. One of the stories
is about Yeldâ, who waits at the border gate and
believes she is a mermaid.
