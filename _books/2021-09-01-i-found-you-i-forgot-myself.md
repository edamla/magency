One must be familiar and infatuated with someone to such an extent that if their heart calls sand
grains pearls, they should appear as pearls to
their eyes. To remain constant on the journey of
love and to find happiness, one must be willing to
risk everything. It is necessary to swallow what is
risked and forget what is swallowed. Love is tested
in every form. The lover’s anguish is felt almost like
a whimper. The state the burning lover should be
in is exactly this. Yearning with the sound of love,
a state of asking for love with love itself. Such a
whimper that won’t cease until accepted, a state
of complaint. Those who give up are unlucky.
The luckless are heartless. And the heartless are
devoid of love. Remember! The secret rests in
silence. Wait. Ecstasy comes with patience and
reverence. Listen! Every creature mentions love in
its own language. And wait. Knock on the door of
emptiness with love, and patiently wait. The secret
will soon reveal itself from within.
