“Love Begins with Death,” says Murat Başaran.
He has found a quite thought-provoking title for
a book. What appears terrifying to one person,
becomes beloved death to another. The issue
lies in perceiving the difference. If you read Murat
Başaran, you will meet his style and his sentences
woven with contemplative motifs with a mixture of
wonder and admiration. (Abdurrahim Karakoç)
Murat Başaran skillfully utilizes historical and
spiritual motifs. Despite his very simple language, it
is poetic and rich... I am expecting many beautiful
works from him... (Ahmet Kabaklı)
Look, Murat is speaking. He has something to
say: Fresh and directed from the last border of reason... I wish all Murats spoke the same way. Loving... is both easy and hard. Dying... is both easy
and hard. Beginning... is both easy and hard. But,
listening to Murat is quite pleasant. Your moments
become more enriched. Suddenly, a ticking clock
within you reminds itself, it chimes. Because Murat
is speaking. (Gürbüz Azak)
