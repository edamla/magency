Journey to the Bookish-Land This book is about the
adventures of Asım, a ten year old boy dreamy boy, and
Uba, a bookworm, on their journey to Bookish Land. Bookish-Land is the magical land of every- thing that concerns
books: Rivers of ink, boats made of ink pots, forests of
letters, massive libraries where novel protagonists reside,
authors, and of course readers. Yet the people of Bookish
Land are about to go extinct. Asım is tasked to save them;
and he does, overcoming many obstacles. Because books
exist only as much as people have dreams.
The first book of the series Asım and Kurt Uba, The
Journey to Bookish-Land invites all of us to dream and
imagine as much as possible.
