From the darkness, a mysterious alien entity
silently glides into Ali’s room, leaving behind an
object that will change his life: a beam clock.
When Ali wakes up in the morning, he discovers this enigmatic device, and an instinctual
curiosity leads him into an unexpected adventure to Planet-9. On this mysterious planet, a
teacher named Acura awakens, shaken by back
pain. The cause of this pain will not only set off
a chain of dangerous events but also determine
the fate of the entire planet.
Planet-9, with its inhabitants of blue-skinned and
red-haired individuals, is beyond our imagination, free from stereotypes, and a unique world.
However, this peaceful existence, lasting for
years, is threatened by the upcoming presidential elections...
Between Earth and Planet-9, a fantastical and
mysterious adventure awaits, woven with clever
and witty dialogues.
