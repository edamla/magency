Jerusalem and the Al-Aqsa Mosque are the
places where the Honorable Prophet (peace be
upon him) ascended to the heavens during the Isra
and Mi’raj. It is the first qibla of Muslims. With the
conquest by Hazrat Umar (may Allah be pleased
with him), it became our holy city entrusted to all
Muslims. Until it was liberated from the Crusaders,
it was the greatest gift of Sultan Saladin Ayyubi,
who rarely smiled, ate little, and drank less, to the
Islamic world. For the consciousness of Jerusalem
to emerge, we must first learn the historical facts.
No cause can be defended without being known.
Jerusalem is the common cause of all Muslims.
InshaAllah, it will bring unity and solidarity to the
Islamic world and will also be the means of salvation for all the oppressed and needy. In this book,
important topics related to Jerusalem and Palestine are presented comprehensively, from the time
of Hz. Umar to the present day, in chronological
order and with illustrations.
