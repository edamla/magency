You can consider this book as a window to the
Age of Bliss. You can also accept a loophole
opened from the age of bliss to bring happiness to
our age. Again, you can admit that this book is not
like the others. Not for killing time, not for fun, not
for business. In fact, you won’t even read this book
to learn something.
While reading this book, you will go to the years
when the Qur’an was revealed, and you will learn
something about the way of living our religion in
the personality of every person who learned the
religion of Islam from two world servers, and you
will immediately try to live it. This means that every
book teaches people somthing according to their
own level, but it cannot give the secrets of happi-
ness of life in definite lines. But those like this book
should be excluded from this rule.
