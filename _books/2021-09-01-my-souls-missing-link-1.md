Psychological health is like a chain. The links
forming this chain are the dynamics that facilitate
coping with the troubles, difficulties, and problems
that come one’s way. When one of these links is
lost, the chain opens up, and all the healthy links
fall apart. Nature does not tolerate emptiness. For
every positive link lost, a negative one takes its
place and settles in. As a person loses the links of
their own soul, the negative behaviors and situations of the people around them slowly start to fill
those voids. For example, when the link of wisdom
is lost, it is replaced by the link of ignorance. If the
link of self-confidence is lost, it is replaced by the
link of inadequacy and worthlessness. If the link of
psychological resilience is lost, it is replaced by the
link of helplessness and hopelessness. When the
links of forgiveness and acceptance are lost, they
are replaced by the links of anger and intolerance.
If the link of knowing how to live with stress is lost,
it is replaced by the link of anxiety and fear. If the
link of setting boundaries with others is lost, it is
replaced by the link of unhappiness and burnout.
So, which missing link is in your soul’s chain?
