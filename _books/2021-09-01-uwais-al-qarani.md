Who was Uwais Al-Qarani, what kind of love gem
was he? Here it is expressed in this work with all
its aspects and all its sources… Her invaluable
beauty was such a beauty that mer-ciful scents
emanated from this beauty. His weeping and
groaning were only for Haqq. He wished to take his
soul to the brink of de-ath and drink a drop of grace
water from the vuslat jug. However, the Sultan of
Soul was not on his throne that day. That day, the
sky was dressed in black.
He stood on the threshold of the soul and said:
- O my Allah, I do not need a physical soul! If I
don’t have my lover there, there is no need for the
world!
It was as if he had let go of both the heart and the
world. He groaned in sorrow and said:
-O Prophet, who casts his sun as a shadow on
the Throne, make the blessing of your gaze a comrade to me!
