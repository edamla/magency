Aristo once said that through careful examination
of the hand, which he described as “the organ of
all organs, the active agent of all passive forces of
the system,” important data about the individual
can be obtained. Later, Georg Meissner stated in
1853 that there is a change in the amount of blood
flow and lymph in the palm during changes in the
person’s state of mind or excitement, and that this
also alters the lines in the palm.
It wasn’t fortune-telling. It wasn’t mind-reading.
Our palms are an indicator panel, much more complex and comprehensive than a car’s dashboard.
This book is about our hands and faces, the indicator panels of our bodies, which, through curiosity
and exploration, reveal information and warnings
about our health status, weak points, and organs
that require attention.
In accordance with the principle that true health
lies in not getting sick, valuable information has
been provided for the preservation of health. Finding benefit is the greatest source of happiness.
Wishing you good health.
