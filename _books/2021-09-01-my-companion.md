My road companion draws attention to the world
of conversation that needs to be experienced. It
offers the hope of rediscovering lost values, suggesting that what has been lost can be found again
where it was lost. It says that to find goodness and
beauty, one must search tirelessly, day and night,
regardless of the season. Negativity and conflicts
have occupied every moment of our lives. At least
throughout the novel, you will stay away from
them...
Positive relationships between men and women,
the struggles of those who cannot have children,
adventurous caravan life, places visited, impressions gained, stories of people encountered on the
road, readings, conversations held morning and
night, are narrated in the progressing time from
yesterday to today, intertwined with the most delicate emotional expression, the folk songs.
My road companion says: “Those who find peace
and happiness are those who know how to live in
the world as travelers.”
