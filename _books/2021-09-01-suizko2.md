The life of Alper, Oğuz and Caner has
changed completely with that plane crash.
The only thing they could save from the accident was Suziko.
Suziko is a young and gentle lady. Like all the other ladies we know ... She’s a robot with artificial intelli-
gence. Artificial intelligence robot Suziko was doing intercontinental research to an unknown country account.
Apart from fighting with the wilderness among the glaciers, trapped pirates and many more were waiting for
them.

Accompanying our heroes in the Antarctic adventure, the events that will take your breath away

white continent’s glaciers, filled with penguins, killer
whales, seal fish, sea lions and many more polar
animals.
