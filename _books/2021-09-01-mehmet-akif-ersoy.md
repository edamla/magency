A poet is duty-bound to shout out. Even if they
find themselves utterly alone on the path they
know is right, they will tirelessly strive for this
land...Akif was a man who knew this truth and
relentlessly pursued it.
A poet will both hear and proclaim the truth and
beauty. They will not conceal what they know. They
will struggle for their homeland and the essence of
their civilization’s people, never faltering.
Akif was a man who knew no relenting.
A poet will feel and write for genuine values, not
for personal gain. The sustenance of their soul will
be only courage and honesty.
Akif was a traveler on the path of honesty and
courage.
Let’s describe our national poet, who spoke of
Islam without distortion, and who was filled with
the excitement of faith, without distorting or diluting
him, in his own manner: Akif was neither this nor
that... He was simply a Muslim. He lived for Islam
and died for Islam.
In this book, you will read about Mehmet Akif
Ersoy’s life and struggles in detail.
