The numerical equivalent of the blessed name
“Allah” in the abjad calculation is 66. This number,
which serves as an inspiration in various fields
from architecture to art, literature to mysticism in Islam, has also inspired us. We attempted to explore
the grand mosque in 66 steps. Upon finishing this
book, you will become acquainted with the intriguing details of Hagia Sophia and observe a different
secret in every corner. In your 66-step journey, you
will embark on a journey through time and traverse
the golden pages of art history. Sometimes accompanied by traces from the ancient temple of Roman
times, Hagia Sophia, and sometimes by traces
from the Ottoman Grand Mosque, Ayasofya-i Kebir
Mosque, you will embark on a journey. You will
witness the contributions of distinguished artists of
the Ottoman Civilization, particularly Mimar Sinan,
to Hagia Sophia. As you meticulously tread through
these 66 steps and uncover the secrets of Hagia
Sophia one by one, you will complete the discovery
of the “Eser” as an “Ambassador of Hagia Sophia
Culture” and reach the Almighty “Creator” who
created all works.
