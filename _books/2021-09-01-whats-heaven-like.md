I miss him/her so much. I wonder where he/she
went. They say, “He/she went to heaven!” They
say there are perfect happiness and unbelievable
beauties there. It’s a place where there is no pain,
sorrow, poverty, or death.
It is said that its stones are jewel-like and its
sands are made of gold. They say its rivers are
made of honey and its seas of milk. They call it
paradise. What kind of place is that? Where are my
cousin and my grandfather? I am full of curiosity...
I really can’t imagine it. Can such a place exist?
Yes, it does!.. And I found the answers to all
these questions in this book.
Come with me to discover the beauties of life
happily, peacefully, and relaxed...
Well then, let’s go on a beautiful journey together!
