The Battle of Kut al-Amara is an epic in which
13,300 British soldiers and commanders surren-
dered unconditionally to the Ottoman army. This
victory was achieved with the contribution of Arab
militia supporting the Ottoman army. This battle,
in which the British were humiliated, is the second
major defeat suffered against the Ottoman Empire
after the Gallipoli Campaign. Britain has tried to
erase this victory from history books and make
it forgotten in all the countries it has influenced.
Under the banner of the Caliphate, the Ottoman
Empire established the Unity of Islam (Islamic
Union) and ensured the strengthening and success
of Muslims against oppressive states around the
world. Kut al-Amara is a historical battle where
despite having different races and cultures, the
Islamic ummah united and erected a monument of
victory against the British. The salvation of Mus-
lims, who still suffer great pains and are always
subjected to Crusader attacks, lies in this spirit of
unity and solidarity. Therefore, the Battle of Kut
al-Amara vividly demonstrates the importance of
this solidarity and unity. The book benefits from
the memoirs and diaries of senior officers who
participated in this battle. The work is enriched
with information, documents, pictures, and maps
obtained from state archives and the General Staff
Headquarters Archive.
