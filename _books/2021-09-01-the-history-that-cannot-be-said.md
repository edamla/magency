Truthful speech is beautiful, it is noble! Why are
there campaigns specifically aimed at discrediting
Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror and Sultan Selim I,
who shaped world history, and Sultan Abdulhamid
II, who carried the Ottoman Empire, which was
on the verge of collapse, for 33 years with great
difficulty? Furthermore, why isn’t Osman Gazi,
who established an order prioritizing humanity and
subdued the mighty Byzantine Empire, promoted
enough out of fear of being taken as an example? In this work, which prioritizes privileges and
highlights the truth instead of Western-planned
history, we’ve said what couldn’t be said! While
doing this, we have stayed away from the class of
ignorant fools who lack knowledge, wisdom, and
understanding of words, and focused on historical
evidence... Only by heeding the warning, “Those
who think headlessly become the tail,” have we
sifted through events through thought and inquiry
and then presented them to the reader.
