Selçuk Beg mounted his horse and rode west-
ward from Yengikent. He crossed mountains and
rivers. He fought with his sword bareback on his
horse to establish a homeland. His grandsons,
Çağrı Beg and Tuğrul Beg, realized his dream
and founded the Seljuk State. The Oghuz Turks
had now laid the foundations of a powerful Turk-
ish state in the east. Çağrı Beg’s son, Alp Arslan,
also followed in his ancestors’ footsteps, taking
an oath to carry the banner of Islam and Turkish-
ness further, and worked with all his might for the
sake of the word of God. He defeated the proud
Byzantine ruler, Romanos Diogenes, at Malazgirt,
opening the gates of Anatolia to the Turks and
Muslims. Thus, the foundations of the Turkification
and Islamization of Anatolia were laid. This book
narrates the epic and extraordinary victory written
by the Great Seljuk Sultan Alp Arslan on the Mala-
zgirt Plain. It also highlights the superior efforts of
the brave armies that established themselves in
Anatolia and the spiritual conquests that sprouted
from the seeds sown by the mystics of Horasan in
these lands.
