This book is about growing up, changing, being
different while staying the same, and being the
same while being different.
The main characters are three cousins: Mahir,
Melike, and Aziz. Guided by their grandmother and
inspired by a young frog, they imagine, marvel, and
learn. They conduct experiments, try again when
things don’t work out, work hard, argue, and laugh
a lot. They embark on new adventures with every
creature they encounter, teetering on the border
between reality and imagination. In this way, they
explore themselves and their surroundings by traversing a thousand worlds in a single day.
