This work presents colors and patterns from the
exemplary life of a blessed prophet, who is unique
in the world in terms of creation. By Allah’s permission, that innocent prophet spoke when he was still
a baby and silenced the deniers who smelled of
polytheism:
“I am truly a servant of Allah, he gave me the
book and made me a prophet. He blessed me
wherever I was and ordered me to pray and zakat
as long as I live.” (Maryam, 30-31)
He is the servant and word of Allah. Like all
life-bearers, he will die. But death has not yet
occurred. Allah has lifted him to high positions, to
the heavens. He is not he who was crucified, and it
is not men who will kill him. When the time comes,
his Allah will take him.
