The Göktürks initiate a tremendous struggle for
independence, aiming to revive their fallen customs and rebuild their collapsed cities from the
dusty pages of history. As all signs of the Dragon Year point towards independence, the brave
people of the Karluk tribe have sworn to stand
by anyone who rebels against China. In the time
span from Kürşad’s rebellion to Aşina Fenzi, there
is no shortage of spilled blood and shed tears. At
a moment when hope seems to be dwindling, a
secret letter from the Çogay Mountains breathes
hope into parched hearts. The key to strengthening
Kutluğ Bey’s organization lies hidden in the healer
of the Karluk tribe, Balca.
You will read about the incredible struggle for
inde pendence of the Göktürks alongside the heal-
er of the steppe, Balca. Simultaneously, you will
marvel at the origins of many Turkic customs and
see how advanced Turkic medicine truly is.
When you realize that many inventions believed
to be of Chinese origin actually originated from the
Uyghurs, you will understand that their present-day
struggle for independence is not in vain. You will
also realize that their independence signifies the
independence of Turkish culture as well.
