Teacher;
The person who raises their most precious heir
with their own hands.
Touches someone’s life and completely transforms
the rest of it.
Sows a seed and years later marvels at the fruit of
that seed with envy.
In this respect, teaching is the most abundant profession... More than a profession, it’s A LOVE...
A teacher in love with their profession knows well
how to make every lesson productive and lasting.
They bring out hidden potentials in unruly or shy
students. They turn some topics that seem like big
obstacles in education into great goods with small
touches.
But how is all this possible?..
Educator and writer Vehbi Vakkasoğlu blended
his personal experiences spanning half a century with striking examples that contributed to his
education. Thus, he laid out the roadmap of living
teaching as A LOVE in the light of universal truths.
We hope that readers will say, “This is what a
teacher is!”
