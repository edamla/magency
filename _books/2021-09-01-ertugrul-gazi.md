The gates of Anatolia were opened to us with
the victory of Malazgirt by Alparslan. Among those
who entered through this gate was the Kayı Tribe.
Under the leadership of Ertuğrul Gazi, the tribe
had completed its search for a place and estab-
lished its tents in Söğüt and Domaniç. Ertuğrul,
who gained the appreciation of Sultan Alaeddin
Keykubat of the Anatolian Seljuk State, fought with
Mongol forces on one side, Byzantine forces and
the Knights Templar on the other, and internally
thwarted centers of betrayal with his superior politi-
cal acumen. Ertuğrul Gazi, who frequently met with
the spiritual leaders of the time and received their
prayers, laid the foundation of the Ottoman Empire,
which would reign for 624 years and continue with
justice and fairness across three continents and
seven climates. Ertuğrul Gazi, with both his devout
personality and his courage and determination, in-
spired the Turkmen tribes and became a beacon of
hope for everyone. As you read his work, you will
witness the resilience, steadfastness, efforts, and
courage of a founding leader, and you will witness
the vision of ‘global domination’.”
