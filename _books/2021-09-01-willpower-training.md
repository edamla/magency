International competition in the field of education
is intense. In this competitive process, states that
understand what influences the drive to work at a
cognitive level are working towards the cultivation
of strong-willed minds. In this context, psychologists and neurologists have developed various
practices by taking into account the dynamics of
the brain to sustain willpower, which can be observed both cognitively and physically.
For the integration of willpower with the processes of education, significant responsibilities fall on
parents, siblings, friends, teachers, and school
administrators. Thus, the education process can
reach its deserved point for both the system and
the teacher and the student.
This book provides guidance to parents, teachers, and students in establishing and strengthening
willpower. It emphasizes that willpower is a learnable and developable quality, and includes various
activities and practices for emotional, cognitive,
and behavioral control.
