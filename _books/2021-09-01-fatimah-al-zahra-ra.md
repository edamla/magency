This book presents gleams from the life of Fati-
mah al-Zahra (Radıyallahü Anha), who is the
highest of the women of the world and heaven.
She was Fatimah, a pearl that fell from the horizon
of heaven to the earth of the world.
Fatima was the light and joy of the eyes of the
Messenger of Allah. She was a part of the blessed
body of the Prophet (pbuh). That Fatima was an
unfading flower that grew from the ro-sary of Haz-
rat Khadijah.
What can I say for her with this weakness? She
was an unfading flower that the Prophet, who was
a mercy to the worlds, kissed and smelled.
Days of the world did not see a bright face like
hers and a flower like her did not grow in the field
of Islam.
