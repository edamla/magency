The Khwarazmshahs, the political heirs of the
Great Seljuk Empire, were a vast Turkic state in
the 12th century, stretching from the Aral Sea to
the Indian Ocean and from the Caucasus to the
Syr Darya River. Genghis Khan, preparing to invade Khwarazm by burning and destroying it, was
getting ready to invade Khurasan, Iran, Iraq, and
Anatolia. Left with only a single sword of sovereignty from his father Sultan Muhammad, the last
lion of Khwarazm, Jalal al-Din, reestablished the
state and stood before the Mongols like a mountain. Jalal al-Din, a sultan who was so sacrificial
for jihad that he would send his mother, wife,
and children to death when necessary, so brave
that he would engage in one-on-one combat with
enemy warriors, and so merciful that he would
forgive those who betrayed him, spent his life from
Khurasan to Anatolia on horseback, covering a
vast geography. His aim was to reunite Muslims
and stand together against the impending Mongol
threat. In this book, you will read about the courageous and heroic life of the great Turkic ruler
Jalal al-Din Khwarazmshah, filled with examples of
courage and bravery.
