It was February of 2010. One day, when I opened
my emails, I saw a call that surprised me greatly.
In the “subject” section of the email, there was only
one word written: “HELP!” Someone was shouting
“Help!” “Hocam (Teacher) I am desperate, can you
help?” The person asking for help was a student
named Büşra. And the words seemed to be written
with tears. The lines I read suddenly took me back
to my youth: “Oh God, help! Save me!” I cried out
to the years... The student who emailed me re-
ported that she was in love. But the bad part was,
the girl was not even 17 yet. And the boy she had
fallen for was an alcoholic... Moreover, he was
someone who did not feel remorse for his mistakes
and almost took pride in them... This book, remain-
ing faithful to the original emails, narrates the long
correspondence between Büşra and me, and with
the permission of Allah, her salvation.
