This novel invites you to the heart-wrenching
adventure of how the country rapidly ascended
to glory when state power was used wisely, and
how it led to sudden collapses and disasters when
personal interests surpassed the state’s interests.
Apart from the fratricidal conflicts of the Anatolian
Seljuk State, it narrates the rise of Baba Alaaddin
Keykubad and the pains of its downfall with the
manipulation of his son, II. Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev,
by palace intrigues. Written by Muhsin İlyas Subaşı, one of our country’s renowned authors, this
work in your hands, staying faithful to historical
truths, sheds light on the hidden aspects of our
history, providing not only moments of pride and
honor but also thought-provoking and sometimes
chilling insights. This piece, featuring intrigues
spun by the state bureaucracy that disregards the
future of the state for its own gain, alongside loves,
passions, delivers objective information in a novelistic style.
