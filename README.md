# Mediterranean Agency

We were established in Istanbul where the continents of Europe and Asia meet, and which has hosted many civilizations, and is the closest and culturally close to all parts of the world.

We work to bring people and their stories, books, souls together. We believe that our mission will be more meaningful with this name because Mediterranean is the point of beginning of the civilization.

We are in service of literature and sofisticated pleasures with our young and dynamic team.
