Communication, as it’s called, is about being
natural and true to yourself. If artifi ciality enters
into the relationships you build with people, forget
about friendships and a sincere, humane life. In
this book, I haven’t tried to pump artifi ciality like
in American-style books. There are mountains of
differences between their culture and ours. Ours
is based on respect and love, while theirs is on
money and power. Don’t let the book change your
current attitudes. Don’t let it infl uence you too
much. Communication is about building bridges
between people, not managing or exerting pressure on them.
