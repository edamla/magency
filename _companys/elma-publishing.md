Our publishing house began its operations under the brand Academyplus Yayınevi within IAT Education Consultancy Ltd. in 1998. The founding partners are Ahmet Şerif İzgören, Mustafa Baştürk, and Mehmet Özaksu. In 2000, it transformed into an independent company named Akademi Artı Yayıncılık Matbaacılık İç ve Dış Ticaret AŞ. Since 2003, we have been continuing our activities under the brand name ELMA YAYINEVİ.
